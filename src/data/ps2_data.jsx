The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore.

      '<p><em>Unreal Tournament</em> is completely different from <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/330/unreal/">Unreal</a>: it is now mainly based on multiplayer, like <a href="/search/?q=Quake+3">Quake 3</a>.</p>\n<p>At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about three or four different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team\'s score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The third mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team\'s flag to score a point. </p>\n<p>The fourth game mode is called assault. This mode requires completion of real missions, such as attacking an enemy base and destroying a specific object in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, for example five or ten minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.</p>\n<p>All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots. Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.</p>',

      '<p><em>Sim Theme Park</em> is the sequel to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/675/theme-park/">Theme Park</a> and the second game in the series. It is a theme park management game where players build their own theme park with roller coasters, rides and food stalls. Each building can be customized for its appearance, prices and also the length of the ride. Roller coasters play an important role as the main attraction for visitors. Players can design a custom ride and then test it from a first-person view.</p>\n<p>In this version the park can be built in four different worlds: Lost Kingdom (prehistoric theme), Halloween World (spooky theme), Wonderland (fantasy theme) and Space Zone (futuristic theme). The game boasts 3D graphics and players can walk around in their park as if they were one of the guests, and go on the rides. Golden Tickets can be won by doing great things to the park and these can be used to buy new rides and parks.</p>',

      '<p>Some time during the 2050\'s, the world is a dangerous place as terrorists, drug czars, and outlaw states rule, using violence and subterfuge as tools in their push for global conquest. A deadly virus dubbed "gray death" is running rampant throughout the world and the only known cure is a chemical known as "Ambrosia" manufactured by the VersaLife corporation. However Ambrosia supplies are scarce and world governments, particularly the United States, carefully monitor and control who receives this cure. As protest against these events, French terrorist organization "Silhouette" bombs the historic symbol of friendship between French and American people, The Statue of Liberty. In response to this attack, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) organization is formed. Building a headquarters underground at Liberty Island, its mission is to attack terrorism and maintain peace around the world. JC Denton is a nano-enhanced agent who has been primed for UNATCO service. While JC\'s brother Paul is already an active agent, JC is beginning his first day of service when the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) suddenly raid a supply of Ambrosia at UNATCO headquarters.</p>\n<p><em>Deus Ex</em> is a dark cyberpunk game that combines gameplay styles of first-person shooter and RPG, with elements of stealth and puzzle-solving. The player assumes the role of JC Denton, UNATCO anti-terrorist agent. Pitted against an elaborate global conspiracy, he must interact with characters, pick up weapons and complete objectives. While JC is essentially fixed within the mission-framework of the game, he can be customized in areas such as weapons, technical skills and physical prowess. Completing objectives rewards the player with skill points, which may be distributed to increase JC\'s proficiencies in eleven different disciplines. The player can choose to increase the damage JC inflicts with various types of weapons, improve his lock-picking or computer hacking abilities, etc. Each such discipline has four levels of proficiency.</p>\n<p>Another way of customizing JC is applying nano-augmentations to his body. These cybernetic implants bestow the hero with super-human abilities, and can be installed on different body parts, up to nine at the same time. Along with combat-related benefits, nano-augmentations also grant JC abilities that can be used to overcome certain obstacles within the game world. Examples of those are jumping to extreme heights, swimming, lifting heavy objects, etc. Weapons can be customized as well: their range, accuracy, and magazine sizes can be increased, and they can be enhanced by attaching scopes, silencers, or laser sights to them.</p>\n<p>The game leads JC to various places all around the globe. The cities he visits, as well as most mission areas, are expansive and fairly open to accommodate different approaches to solving the same problems, depending on the player\'s preferred style of play. Most of the missions can be tackled in various ways, e.g. with brute force, stealth, or extensive usage of lock-picking and computer hacking abilities. At certain points, the course of the storyline can also be influenced by the decisions made by the player. Similarly to <a href="/search/?q=System+Shock">System Shock</a> games, the environment is largely interactive, the player being able to pick up, use, and discard various types of objects.</p>',

      "<p>Admiral Razorbeard and his gang of robot pirates have enslaved all the creatures in Rayman's world, including the peaceful Teensies and the Lums, which give life to the earth. Rayman has been captured by the pirates as well and is lamenting his troubles in his prison cell when he meets his good friend, Globox. Globox has smuggled in a silver Lum, given to him by the great fairy, Ly. With the power of the silver Lum, Rayman is able to once more shoot his fists. With his power restored, the pair escape the flying prison ship and embark on another adventure to save the entire world!</p>\n<p><em>Rayman 2: The Great Escape</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"/search/?q=008888310013\">Rayman</a>, a 2D side-scrolling platform game. Unlike the previous game, <em>Rayman 2</em> is entirely in free-roaming 3D environments, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3533/super-mario-64/\">Super Mario 64</a>. Rayman has many unique abilities that can help him get around the world. In addition to being able to shoot his fists, he can use his hair to hover like a helicopter, and even glide on air currents in certain places. He can climb certain walls and ceilings and can even use his fists to swing from special purple Lums which are shaped like rings. Rayman also has many unique items at his disposal, such as powder kegs which can be carried or fly like jets, strange warheads with legs that he can ride and steer like bucking mules, and gigantic plums that can be thrown into the water to create new paths.</p>\n<p>Rayman's goal is to find the four masks of the world, which allow the owner to reawaken Polokus, the spirit of the world. These masks are scattered far and wide, and are well hidden and guarded, so it is not an easy task. By gathering the yellow Lums, Rayman will gain access to new worlds, which will take him to the locations of new masks. Collecting yellow Lums also rewards him with new powers and life meter extensions.</p>\n<p>The Nintendo 64 and Windows platforms are the original versions of the game. The Nintendo DS version sticks closest to this version.</p>\n<p>The Dreamcast version adds a new area to the original version called Globox Village which contains exclusive mini-games. The mini-games are unlocked by collecting six hidden Globox crystals. Also, other changes include The Hall of Doors being changed into a new place called The Isle of Doors and more Robo-Pirates to contend with, including a new type not seen in the original version. The iOS and Nintendo 3DS versions are based on this version but don't include the Globox Village section. However, the 3DS version features a dynamic difficulty curve, with the game getting easier if too many lums are missed.</p>\n<p>The PlayStation version features a heavy alteration of the levels with some being merged and some being removed altogether, although there are also some new areas as well. This includes a new unlockable bonus area that was from the originally planned 2D version of the game that was scrapped. The amount of collectible Lums was reduced from 1,000 to 800. In this version characters are also voiced with actual real languages instead of the whisper speak of the other versions. </p>\n<p>The PlayStation 2 version adds minigames, exclusive items like the Lumz Radar, and offers more abilities for Rayman to purchase and use.\nAlong with some expanded level revisions with lums being placed in different locations, there are three new bosses to contend with. The Hall of Doors has become hub locations, The Minisaurus Plain, Globox's House, and The Rainbow Creek. Bonus challenges can also be played by freeing caged Familiar Spirits. These prisoners are exclusive to this version of the game. The game also gives the option to use either the real language voice-overs or the older version's style and lets players save mid-level.</p>",

      '<p>For over a thousand years, the races of the Ancients and the Kreegans were waging an interstellar war. Eventually, the heroes of the planet Enroth and their allies managed to stop the invading Kreegans. However, the Ancients would rather see an entire world annihilated than let it fall into the hands of their sworn enemies. A planeswalker named Escaton, serving the Ancients, arrives on the continent of Jadame and unleashes a great storm, damaging the borders to Elemental Planes. Terrifying creatures begin to invade Enroth. Unexpectedly, the fate of the world lies in the hands of a lowly caravan guard from Dagger Wound Islands.</p>\n<p><em>Day of the Destroyer</em> is the eighth installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/645/might-and-magic-vii-for-blood-and-honor/">For Blood and Honor</a>. The game\'s engine is virtually unchanged from the one used in the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/812/might-and-magic-vi-the-mandate-of-heaven/">sixth</a> game, apart from a few minor tweaks. The biggest difference from all the previous games in the series is the player\'s inability to create an entire party. Instead, the player generates one character, while the others at first act as NPCs in the game world and must be recruited. The active party can hold up to five characters. Instead of the traditional classes, the differentiation of the characters is mainly manifested in their races, which include, among others, minotaurs, vampires, and dark elves. The player can also choose to ally with different factions and complete different quests for them.</p>',

      '<p>After Kurt Hectic, the janitor extraordinaire has bravely ventured into the perilous minecrawlers and averted the alien threat to the Earth, he returns to his friends, the genius scientist Dr. Fluke Hawkins, and his invention, the six-legged robotic dog Max, to celebrate their great victory. However, they find out that one minecrawler in Canada still hasn\'t been destroyed. Kurt is sent to complete the mission, but as a result, gets kidnapped by an alien being known as Shwang Shwing. Doc and Max rush to his rescue and soon realize that they are up against a much bigger threat, involving an alien empire and galactic conquest. The fate of the Earth is in their hands.</p>\n<p><em>MDK 2</em> is the sequel to the third-person shooter <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/344/mdk/">MDK</a>, largely following the same gameplay template and re-creating its humorous tone. Most of the gadgets used by Kurt in the previous game return in the sequel. In addition to levels in which the player controls Kurt, the game introduces two new playable characters, Doc and Max, with their own levels. The three protagonists have distinctly different gameplay styles. Kurt is a versatile fighter who is able to shoot enemies from afar using his trusty sniper mortal; the boss encounters of his levels usually involve various sniping strategies. Kurt can also use his special suit to glide from platform to platform. Max is the most straightforward of the three; having six legs, he can shoot from four guns at once, and also use a jetpack for long jumps. The Doc is physically the weakest character; he relies on stealth and manipulation of items to solve problems. He is able to fight using an atomic toaster, and can also consume plutonium, which transforms him into a monster for a short duration.</p>\n<p>The PlayStation 2 version as well as the later Wii version based on the PS2 version introduce different difficulty levels absent in the other versions.</p>',

      '<p>On its course to the Alpha Quadrant, the U.S.S. Voyager is attacked by an unknown ship and is transported to a graveyard of ships with a giant space station in the middle. The player is Ensign Alex Munro (male or female, according to the player\'s choice), second in command of the newly formed Hazard Team, an elite force of Voyager security personnel. It\'s up to the player and your team to find out why the Voyager was brought here and to find a way to escape. To do so, they will have to complete several missions on different ships and space stations.</p>\n<p><em>Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force</em> is a first-person shooter that uses the <a href="/search/?q=3D+Engine:+id+Tech+3+(Quake+III)">Quake III</a> engine. The different types of missions range from pure combat to stealth missions. The enemies include many well-known Star Trek races like the Borg or the Klingons, but also other alien races and creatures invented specifically for this game. All the weapons have a futuristic design, ranging from the low-damage hand phaser to stasis weapons and grenade launchers. The weapons either gradually recharge ammunition automatically, or require ammunition that can be collected from other weapons or terminals.</p>\n<p>Though the player directly controls only Munroe, up to three teammates usually accompany him (or her) during the missions and fight the enemies, controlled by the AI. Scripted events and cutscenes often involve actions committed by these teammates. When not on a mission, Munroe can explore the space ship, talking to characters directly or overhearing their conversations with each other. A few decisions can be made by the player during the course of the game, which may influence the subsequent events.</p>\n<p>A multiplayer mode called "Holomatch" is also available.</p>',

The Australian businessman Ozzie Mandrill is turning the Caribbean into an attraction for tourists. And on top of that, Elaine\'s mansion is being demolished! Naturally, it\'s up to our hero to revert the things back to normal, even if that means traveling to exotic islands and solving puzzles on the way.</p>\n<p><em>Escape From Monkey Island</em> is a direct sequel to <a href="/search/?q=Curse+Monkey+Island"> The Curse of Monkey island</a>, and is the fourth game in the <a href="/search/?q=Monkey+Island"> Monkey Island</a> series. The gameplay relies mainly on inventory-based puzzles and branching dialogues, just like in the previous installments. The interface is similar to that of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/201/grim-fandango/"> Grim Fandango</a>: mouse is not used, and the interaction is done via context-sensitive commands that appear on the screen whenever you navigate Guybrush close to an object. The game utilizes pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D character models.</p>',

Each weapon has a special "Rune Power" that can be activated for a short time by gathering energy from runes. Ragnar is also able to equip shields. Multiplayer is included as well, in which each player controls a character equipped with various weapons, in a fashion similar to Ragnar.</p>',

      '<p>King Taskan IV celebrates the end of a civil war. The valiant warrior Hype is given the Sword of Peace for his heroic deeds and his loyalty to the throne. However, a mysterious black knight named Barnak appears and casts a powerful spell on Hype, turning him into a statue and sending him two hundred years into the past. The magician Gogoud brings Hype back to life, and the brave knight has to figure out a way to return to his own time, defeat Barnak, and marry his sweetheart Vibe.</p>\n<p>Based on the medieval castle toy series from Playmobil, <em>Hype: The Time Quest</em> is an action game with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements, similar in style to 3D installment of the <a href="/search/?q=zelda">Zelda</a> series. Hype primarily fights with close-range weapons, though he can also cast offensive spells in three elemental categories. Hostile areas occupy the largest portion of the game; Hype will explore dungeons, face boss monsters, and will have to hunt for quest items needed to advance the story. Some of the puzzles revolve around time-traveling concept.</p>',

      '<p>On a far away planet, three races fight for control of the few landmasses available: the marooned Meccs, who specialize in firearms and other things that go boom, the mystical and cold-blooded Reapers, who were the original inhabitants of the planet, but were forced to live in the sea by Kabuto, the third character; a truly gigantic monster with a ravenous appetite and a fondness for performing wrestling maneuvers on those the size of his hand.</p>\n<p>You can control any of these races (although in the single player mode, you have to progress through the storylines of the Meccs and Reapers first) in their bid to be the dominant species. Each species varies in the way they play the game and have vastly different types of attacks available to them.</p>\n<p><em>Giants: Citizen Kabuto</em> is an action/real-time-strategy game that emphasizes action. While there is base-building and resource management for most of the races, it is done through a simple to control interface and one or two keystrokes. The majority of the game is spent in a third person view (first person mode is available) jet-packing/warping/leaping about the 3D landscape. Single player sessions consist of missions with specific goals, such as rescuing Smarties or recovering lost items. Multiplayer options include standard deathmatch, capture the Smartie (flag), the above with basebuilding as an option.</p>\n<p>Other creatures also inhabit the islands. From the meek Smarties (who are employed to build your bases or eaten as a primary source of protein, depending on your species), to the cow-like vimps to the deadly rippers, the fauna of the planet will either try to kill you or avoid being killed/eaten/captured. While not so energetic, the flora of the islands can be crushed, knocked over, or burned in careless combat (or by Kabuto not paying attention). </p>\n<p>Game controls are similar to <a href="/search/?q=Shiny">Shiny\'s</a> <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/344/mdk/">MDK</a> and can best be described as a simplified shooter interface. You can run, jump, turn, shoot, and strafe. Beyond that, a half-dozen keystrokes are all you need to play (and some, like Kabuto\'s howls, are for fun and show). </p>\n<p>The alien world in the game is bright and presented with vibrant colors. In addition, the game tries to maintain a humorous streak. The single player game has goofy dialogue and a few jokes spread along its story line and even the multiplayer is lighthearted, with Smarties cheering you on as you carry them on your back, among other little sounds and nuances.</p>',

      '<p>It\'s 2032. The planet is now ruled by the World Coalition Government which annexed 80% of the countries, with the remaining quickly dragged into the WCG. While their official goal was to solve humankind\'s problems, it was about money. Massive spending bankrupted poorer countries, and soon all traces of individual government disappeared. For those who were poor, the situation didn\'t improved one bit, and for the richer, maintaining the status was done at the expense of their privacy and personal freedoms. To make things worse, life outside the major cities, far from the atmosphere processors is nearly impossible, as the so-called "Wilderness Preserves" are poisoned, and those who venture into them risk a painful death.</p>\n<p>Konoko, fresh out from TCTF (Technology Crimes Task Force, a secret police to take cyber drugs and weapons from the streets, as well as explore the induced technophobia to operate and investigate on a blank check permission) academy is placed under the command of Terrance Griffin and Dr. Kerr and linked to a SLD - an android - called Shinatama, who is neurally linked to her. However, Konoko knows next to nothing about her past, other that she was orphaned at the age of three and felt "different" to other people while was being brought up under the wing of TCTF. After many years in training, she has finally the chance to prove herself to Griffin and the TCTF, and so, heads for a warehouse rumoured to be under the control of the Syndicate, a criminal organization which grew exponentially after a young man called "Boss Muro" climbed to the top of the organization.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the classic Anime series <em><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/4934/ghost-in-the-shell-universe/">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> by <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/61968/masamune-shirow/">Shirow Masamune</a>, gameplay is a mix between generic third-person shooter and a classic beat\'em up. While Konoko has at her disposal several hand-to-hand acrobatic moves (with more unlocked as the player advances), she can also find weapons in the levels, and the decision to go armed or bare-fisted is only up to the player. Each weapon either draws from ballistic or energy cell clips, the number of rounds in each clip depending on the weapon: a Black Adder (a short, one-hand machine gun like an Uzi) can get 30 rounds from a ballistic clip, while a Mercury Bow (a sniper railgun sans scope) only two. Combined with the limited availability of clips, this adds a strategic element to the game, as the player can only carry a weapon at a time, so if a powerful weapons runs out of ammo, the player must choose between keeping the weapon and fight hand to hand with the enemies until Konoko finds fresh ammo clips, or discard it for a lesser gun that uses different ammo. However, if the player runs out of ammo completely when facing a tough challenge, Konoko can "overdose" on hypo sprays (used to heal damage) by using them over her natural health bar, which provides her with faster movement and tougher blows.</p>',

      "<p>Joseph was a simple boy living in the village of Ciran. One day, a mysterious man gave him a magical ring containing the power to summon demons. When Ciran was attacked by raiders, Joseph used the ring, but could not control its power, and the demon devastated the village. Joseph vowed to never use the ring again. But things change when soldiers from Orenia, a continent ruled by Emperor Murod, attack the town Joseph has settled in, looking for a boy born with the mark of a Summoner. Joseph has to flee and find companions as he realizes that the Emperor must be stopped at all costs.</p>\n<p><em>Summoner</em> is a 3D story-driven role-playing game somewhat influenced by the Japanese variety of the genre, having a linear plot progression and random enemy encounters. The player controls a party of characters who join the protagonist as dictated by the plot. Combat flows in real time, with the player actively controlling only one character. The others can be given general orders regarding their usage of spells, melee or ranged attacks, etc. The controlled character can execute combo chains if the player presses a key at the right moment. At some point in the game Joseph gains the ability to summon powerful monsters to help the party in battles. The game also features side quests and skill-based character development.</p>",

      "<p><em>Super Bust-A-Move</em> is a real-time puzzle game similar to its predecessors in the <em>Bust-A-Move</em> series. It adds a new multiplayer mode and features graphical enhancements.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game, as with the previous titles in the series, is to remove a collected number of coloured bubbles from the game screen. To do so, at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the coloured bubbles from a launcher, sending the bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or more together of the same colour to clear them from the screen. If you're too slow, the collection of bubbles moves down the screen towards you, and the game will end if it reaches the bottom.</p>\n<p>Classic mode features a number of bubble puzzles previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while Normal mode has some new variations on the bubble removing theme. Two players can also compete against each other.</p>",

    description:
      "<p><em>Crazy Taxi</em> is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks, and even underwater, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the color represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. </p>\n<p>In the main Arcade mode, there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token, the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.</p>\n<p>Next to the Arcade mode, there is an Original mode and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed-down courses. In the regular modes, it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race, the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B, or A, with S for outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version, there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers' different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</p>",

      "<p>In the late 22nd century, humans have colonized Mars, and also set up a few colonies in Jupiter's orbit. Giant robots known as Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicles (L.E.V.) have helped them to achieve this lofty goal. However, as time passed, the inhabitants of the Earth started to treat the space colonists, whom they called \"Enders\", with suspicion, subjecting them to harsh laws and repercussions. Eventually, some of the colonists founded rebel organizations, armed with particularly powerful mechas called Orbital Frames. A young colonist from Jupiter, Leo Stenbuck, unexpectedly comes into contact with an Orbital Frame named Jehuty. A terrible power is in his hands - will he use it for good, or for evil?..</p>\n<p><em>Zone of the Enders</em> is an action game that primarily focuses on combat between the player-controlled Jehuty and hostile Orbital Frames. Jehuty can use an energy sword, an energy projectile, and various sub-weapons to defeat his foes. As the player progresses, Jehuty's arsenal grows, and he is able to learn new abilities. Jehuty can also hover and fly, grab and throw enemies, and use booster jets to move quickly and dodge enemy attacks. Some objectives require the player to minimize damage to nearby buildings and civilians.</p>",

All craft can be customized with parts earned by completing missions.</p>\n<p>Includes 5 different game modes: Adventure Mode, in which you fly a series of missions searching for the map pieces needed to find the legendery Tower of Maximus; Target Mode, in which you must navigate through a series of targets; Sky Canvas Mode, in which you paint patterns in the sky; Training Mode, a basic tutorial; and Free Flight Mode, in which you can fly freely around any of the maps you've seen in the adventure mode.</p>\n<p>Missions in the adventure mode include such daring stunts as landing on moving trains, landing on an aircraft carrier in the middle of a storm, mid-air refuelling, and flying through caves, canyons, and forests.  Weather effects are well-modelled, and you'll be buffetted around by strong winds and pushed down by strong rain and snow.</p>",

      "<p><em>Onimusha: Warlords</em> is set in 16th century Japan during the period of the civil war dominated by Nobunaga Oda. You play Samanosuke Akechi, who dies during an attempt to stop the kidnapping of young princess Yuki, the sister to Yoshitatsu Saito. However, Akechi is given another chance at life, and is handed the gauntlet of the Ogres. </p>\n<p>With this new power Samanosuke must fight through the monster-filled halls of Inabayama Castle. As monsters are defeated, their souls are absorbed by the gauntlet, increasing its power. Some souls restore Samanosuke's health and magic, while others can be used to power up weapons, armor, and items. Powering up weapons will increase their damage and the strength of their associated magic, and is also required to pass by special locks throughout the castle. Items will need to be found in one part of the castle to unlock doors or otherwise bypass obstacles elsewhere in the castle, and sometimes the player will take control of Samanosuke's companion Kaede while Samanosuke is incapacitated in some way. Kaede can reach some locations that are beyond Samanosuke as well as pick locks and throw kunai, but she can not absorb souls or open any lock intended for the wearer of the Ogre gauntlet.</p>\n<p>The 2018 enhanced HD version for Windows and consoles now supports 16:9 wide screen resolution as well as the old 4:3 ratio. Improved controls now allow players to move and fight with analog-stick precision.</p>",

      "<p>A young man named Eike Kusch strolls through the quiet patriarchal German town Lebensbaum. Suddenly, a tremendous blow darkens the sight of his eyes, and the next thing he can see is a very strange room filled with bizarre objects, and a voice talking to him from nowhere. A mysterious being known as Homunculus tells Eike that he has been stabbed to death. Homunculus gives Eike a time-travelling device and brings him back to life a short while before his murder took place. From that moment on, Eike's miraculously acquired second chance turns into a constant race against time, as he tries to escape from his destiny. In order to alter the course of events, preventing the unknown person from carrying out his murder, Eike will have to travel back in time as far as the 16th century, meeting people closely connected to his own existence and changing the fabric of reality.</p>\n<p><em>Shadow of Memories</em> (<em>Shadow of Destiny</em> in North America) is an adventure game. There are no action elements in the game, and the protagonist has no health bar. Each chapter has a time limit, during which Eike has to find a way to prevent the murderer from killing him. This is mainly achieved by traveling through time to different hours, days, years, and even centuries. Obtaining a crucial item, having a conversation with a specific character, or performing another action in the past will prevent Eike from getting killed. Time-traveling requires energy units, which can be found by exploring the town. If Eike fails to achieve the goal at hand within the allotted time and prevent his murder, the chapter must be restarted.</p>\n<p>During the course of the game the player will have several choices and opportunities to change the future in various ways. Due to the time-traveling feature, many objectives can be accomplished in non-linear ways, branching the storyline and eventually resulting in eight different endings, six of which can be achieved during the first playthrough, and two others unlocked after having reached the other six.</p>",

      '<p>A port of the arcade game, <em>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</em> is the follow-up to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3590/gauntlet-legends/">Gauntlet: Legends</a> and another installment in the long-running <a href="/search/?q=Gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the <em>Gauntlet</em> games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never-ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. </p>\n<p>This version contains the characters and levels from <em>Gauntlet: Legends</em>, plus the new characters and levels from the <em>Dark Legacy</em> arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.</p>\n<p>There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you\'ll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there is some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. </p>\n<p>Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird\'s eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the gameplay is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.</p>\n<p>While levels can be gained and characters saved, <em>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</em> is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.</p>',

You're merely racing in one of three dozen cars (many based on real-life designs) in fifteen different tracks, ranging from airports to old mines to specially designed stunt arenas. Taking part in either races, stunt shows, or in one-on-one duels, you'll need to learn not only how to drive, but also when to use power-ups and where the best short cuts are. Power-ups include oil slicks to bombs to a tornado that cleans the course ahead of you. Through the Championship mode, you'll be able to unlock all the vehicles and tracks.</p>",

Though scars of the battle still mark the land, time has passed and the people of the world have built new civilizations and kingdoms to colonize the planet. The "Day of Darkness" will someday occur, heralding the resurrection of Valmar.</p>\n<p>Ryudo is a "GeoHound", a mercenary available for hire, usually for slaying monsters and recovering goods. Working with a talking bird named Skye, who sites on Ryudo\'s shoulder, they will "do anything" if the price is right. One day Ryudo receives a job from a branch of the Church of Granas, they ask Ryudo to become a bodyguard for a young priestess named Elena during a prayer ceremony. During the ceremony, strange events occur requiring Ryudo to escort Elena on a journey towards the </p>\n<p><em>Grandia 2</em> is a 3D RPG, viewed from a top-down perspective for most of the game and a 3rd person view during battle. Controlling Ryudo, the player will explore various locations, locating townspeople and objects within an area to interact with. Towns and dungeons are displayed in the same manner, though dungeons tend to be mazes filled with monsters and towns tend to be friendly areas filled instead with conversation and shops. Any monsters present in these areas will be shown walking around. Walking over to and touching the monster in any way will activate a battle. If the monster notices the player approaching it is considered a normal battle, if Ryudo is able to approach undetected the player\'s party will gain the initiative in battle, if any party member besides Ryudo is approached by the enemy then the party loses initiative.</p>\n<p>In battle, each character is able to choose from a list of actions that include "attack combos" (standard attack command), Special Abilities/Magic, "Critical Strike", Guard, Evade and Escape. Critical Strikes are weaker versions of attack combos with the advantage that they can block an enemy\'s action. This partly depends on the positions of the character on the action bar, displayed at the bottom of the screen, which shows each character\'s (and enemy\'s) time to act within the battle. Some magic spells and special abilities are also able to block enemy actions, though they take longer to perform than normal attacks. Both combo attacks and critical attacks require the attacker to run up to the enemy in order to perform the action. This depends heavily on the character\'s individual movement as well as other characters acting as obstacles on the screen. Successfully defeating enemies in battle awards experience points, power points, magic points, gold, and items.</p>',

      "<p>Edward Carnby, private eye of the paranormal, is back.</p>\n<p>Carnby's best friend, Charles Fiske, has been found dead near Shadow Island, a mysterious island near Maine. It is your duty to take up the investigation and find out the secrets of Shadow Island. But you're not going alone... your companion will be a redhead by the name of Aline Cedrac who has her own reasons for tagging along. Aside from being a woman and inexperienced in the world of danger, she is the only one with the knowledge for translating the ancient Abkhani tabloids which may hold the secrets behind Carnby's friend's death and the disappearance of Aline's father.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving on the island, your plane has been shot down by the things unknown, and the heroes have no other choice but to jump with a parachute, thus separating them on the island.</p>\n<p>Now you choose the character to play with, either as Edward Carnby or Aline Cedrac, as they explore the mysterious and gloomy island with all its secrets and parallel stories that contain different locations and tasks for different characters, thus adding the level of replayability in a different experience - Carnby's story is more action oriented while Cedrac has more puzzles to solve. </p>\n<p>Just like in the predecessors you move your characters through pre-rendered backgrounds while the camera perspective switches around. You collect various items and books which are used to solve puzzles. Many situations can only be solved with violence which means you'll have to use guns to get rid of your foes. Aiming is manual and especially when playing Cedrac ammo is scarce. Saving a game uses up a save medallion which can be found during the game.</p>",

      '<p>The Ultor Corporation of Mars is successful because of the mineral wealth of that planet. It employs a number of miners and scientists to mine the Noachite ores far underground. The miners are constantly pressured by the guards to work harder and faster, while at the same time being forced to share their meager resources. While the mines itself are dangerous, so too is the mysterious plague that has broken out among the ranks of miners, killing many. Into this low morale situation, propaganda against Ultor has begun appearing, signed only by "Eos". These pamphlets and posters urge the miners to rise up against their oppressors and take a stand, also recruiting members into their secretive "Red Faction". As a result of Eos\' efforts, tensions are rising high between the Ultor corporation and its workers, any little incident could ignite...</p>\n<p><em>Red Faction</em> is a first-person shooter. Players take the role of Parker, a miner working underground for the Ultor Corporation. Equipped in an environment suit, Parker is protected from various hazards and able to breathe deep in the mines and in airless locations. At times, Parker also needs to travel undercover in a less protective disguise. Parker defends himself with a variety of weapons, most of which feature a primary and secondary firing mode. The weapons are divided into: hand weapons such as riot shields and flamethrowers, light arms which include pistols and shotguns, heavy arms featuring rocket launchers and sub-machine guns and finally weapons that are thrown or placed such as grenades and explosives. The game features a variety of vehicles to drive in first-person; including jeeps, drillers, flying craft and submarines. In order to survive, Parker must link up and aid his fellow miners, receiving direction and objectives via com-link messages.</p>\n<p><em>Red Faction</em> features a game engine called Geo-Mod. It allows holes to be blasted into all manner of terrain including floors, walls and ceilings. While limited to certain surfaces, such as rock, ice and concrete, this nonetheless results in a more destructible environment where deviation from the level design is encouraged. Players are able to at multiple points, create their own paths, tunneling past obstacles and into new environments. Only heavy explosives; such as missiles, torpedoes, grenades and plastique will allow the terrain destruction of this sort.</p>',

      "<p><em>Kessen</em> is a strategy game that tells the story of the events that brought feudal Japan out of a century of civil war and installed the Tokugawa Shogunate as the dominant political entity for the next two hundred years.</p>\n<p>As either Tokugawa Ieyasu or his opponents, you'll engage in real time battles, including Sekigahara, one of the largest and most famous battles in Japanese history. Victory or defeat will steer you down a campaign trail, taking you either through the historical events of the time or down fictional 'what if?' scenarios. </p>\n<p>Battles take place in real time, with you instructing your various generals on where to lead their troops, who to engage, and what special actions to perform. These special actions, such as firing your cannons, charging your opponent, or unleashing a flight of arrows, are depicted in close-up, cinema-like cut-scenes. </p>\n<p>Before, after, and sometimes even during battles you'll be shown cut-scenes that depict the personal struggles of your various subordinates.</p>",

      "<p><em>Twisted Metal: Black</em> is the fifth game in the car-combat series. Only on the PlayStation 2, the game includes old favorites and a lot of new characters. The game has a very dark and gothic theme to it, with the music to back it up. Detailed graphics, day/night cycle, particle effects, and a constant 60 frames per second. The game also boasts a multiplayer mode, with 1-4 multiplayers, over ten arenas (some specific to multiplayer), and a cooperative mode, so instead of fighting each other, you can work together. The game's soundtrack consists of techno/gothic music, with some industrial, and acoustic guitar bits, especially the ending credits, <em>Paint It Black</em>.</p>",

      '<p>Max Payne was a police officer of the New York City police. On one terrible day, his wife and newborn daughter were killed by three junkies, who broke into his apartment after having ingested a new designer drug known as Valkyr. After the tragedy, Max quit the police force and joined the Drug Enforcement Administration. Three years later, during a raid on a mafia compound that was reportedly trafficking Valkyr, his best friend and fellow DEA agent Alex is killed, and he becomes the prime suspect in his murder. Now Max is all alone in the cold, snowy night of New York. The mob is out to get him. The police are out to get him. The only way out is with guns blazing, because he has nothing to lose.</p>\n<p><em>Max Payne</em> is a third person shooter stylistically influenced by film noir, "hardboiled" detective stories, and Hong-Kong action cinema. Max can perform rolls and leaps to try and dodge enemy fire. The weapons at his disposal range from baseball bats to Ingram sub-machine guns, grenades, Molotov cocktails, and others. A unique feature of the game is the usage of the so-called <em>Bullet Time</em> - a time-slowing ability that was popularized by the first <a href="/search/?q=Matrix"> Matrix</a> movie. Activating the Bullet Time slows down everything that happens around Max (including his own movements), allowing for slow, but precise performance of moves to take care of his enemies. A special meter indicates how much time the effect will last, and how long Max needs to wait until it can be activated again.</p>\n<p>Cutscenes in the game are presented as comic book-style graphical panels accompanied by voice-overs.</p>',

    description:
      '<p>400 Years ago, a war between the Eastern Continent and the Western Wizard Army destroyed the world as a great power was unleashed. Time has passed and in present day, the power-hungry General Flag has organized a ritual to awaken this power once more: the Dark Genie. Barely controlled by a spell, the Dark Genie once again breaks the world, beginning with the village of Norune. The only survivor of Norune is a boy named Toan, son of the great hero Ada. As Toan surveys the destruction, the Spirit King appears and tells him that all is not lost; pieces of the world, including buildings and people, have been sealed away in protective Atla spheres. Using a magic glove called the Atlamillia, Toan must resurrect the world and find the powers necessary to defeat the Dark Genie.</p>\n<p><em>Dark Cloud</em> is an action-RPG title, often compared to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/7134/soul-blazer/">Soul Blazer</a>, played from the 3rd person perspective. Toan must enter randomly generated dungeons where he will battle monsters and recover Atla spheres. Toan battles with a sword, which can be slashed directly in front of him or powered up for a stronger blow. During his travels, Toan encounters other characters who will offer to aid him and can be switched to during dungeons, with individual statistics and weapons. Items are also found and shared among the party, including restorative items, attack items and general power-ups. Each character has a thirst meter, which much be replenished or health will start to drain. Should a character lose all their health, they will fall in battle and be returned to town unless Stand-In powder is used, in which case that character is unavailable and control passes to another.</p>\n<p>Toan is the only character able to collect Atla spheres which contain different items needed to restore the villages destroyed by the Dark Genie. Rebuilding is done outside the dungeon in a designated village area. Buildings can be placed down, rotated and moved as need be. They can also be upgraded with additional furniture and people (usually the owners of the building). As the dungeons are conquered and the area becomes more lifelike, treasure chests start appearing around the town and villagers often become friendlier. Some villagers have additional requests, such as being placed facing the east, for the placement of their homes.</p>\n<p>Each character in Toan\'s party uses a unique weapon, but several different types of weapon under each category can be collected. As weapons are used, they gain Absorption (Abs). These Abs points are used as "experience" for the weapon and can upgrade the weapon\'s abilities. Each weapon features a number of "slots" to which power-up items can be attached, any items attached to slots will be absorbed when the weapon is upgraded. Each weapon has certain attributes which must be improved in order to "build up" to a different type of weapon. Additionally, any weapon reaching level 5 can be broken into a Synthsphere, an item containing 60% of its abilities, which can then be attached to slots on different weapons. In this manner, weapons can always be upgraded or used in the improvement of another weapon throughout the game. The game also features certain sequences where buttons must be pressed in the correct order and correct timing in order to progress.</p>',

      "<p>On December 24, 2005, Sergeant Dennis Riley, member of the special U.S. Marine Team Red Light receives a distress call from Fort Stewart, a top secret research facility in Antarctica. The signal requests an immediate air strike on the base. The team is sent to investigate the matter, but their plane crashes in the tundra. When Dennis arrives at the facility he finds out that something horrible has occurred, and must fight for his life as he encounters mutated creatures and is in danger of getting infected himself.</p>\n<p><em>Extermination</em> is a survival horror game. The player character has limited ammunition for his firearms and in many cases it is advisable to run away from monsters. Besides the traditional health bar Dennis also has an Infection Rate, which may gradually grow when attacked by monsters. Once his Infection Rate reaches 100% he becomes very weak and would eventually mutate into a monster. Infection can be countered by applying MTS vaccines. </p>\n<p>The player character's default weapon, a special purpose rifle, can be customized with enhancements such as zoom scope, flashlight grip, radar, and parts which convert it to other weapon types such as flame thrower, shotgun, or rocket launcher. Dennis can also fight with a knife. Throughout the game batteries must be collected and used for activating various machines and saving the game.</p>",

By ringing the four bells across the land, Klonoa can restore harmony, but the Sky Pirate Leorina is in hot pursuit, after Klonoa's magic ring...</p>\n<p><em>Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil</em> is a 3D side-scrolling platformer. The main goal of the game is to get to the end of each level (or 'Vision'), but there are also special goals to achieve. Firstly, each Vision contains six Momett Dolls hidden in each level. Secondly, there are Dream Stones scattered throughout each level - green ones are worth one, while blue ones are worth five. Certain puzzles also contain tricky use of the \"Dream Spirit\", which doubles the value of all collected Dream Stones. New to <em>Klonoa 2</em> are hoverboard sections, which play at a faster, more action-oriented pace.</p>\n<p>But what makes Klonoa unique is his abilities. Klonoa can shoot a 'wind bullet' into foes, which puffs them up and allows Klonoa to carry them. Klonoa can then launch them straight at foes, or jump with them, giving him an extra boost. If he needs extra length to his jump, holding the jump button will allow him to hover for a little longer, too. Different enemies have different effects - for example, certain foes have propellers on their heads and will rocket you into the sky, while others will act like time bombs and explode after a short while.</p>",

Six teams are competing to win a racing championship, the player taking control of any of the two riders available in each team. The game retains the action elements of the previous titles: as before, opponents will try to sabotage the race, and the player-controlled character is able to answer them with his own arsenal of weapons.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous installments, weapons cannot be picked up on the road: the player has to purchase them with the money earned after a successful race. All weapons now deplete the player's weapon bar with each shot. Another change is the absence of the \"nitro\" boosts utilized in the previous entries; they have been replaced with a turbo system, where using the boost drains energy from the player character's shields.</p>",

      "<p>Cookie and Cream are two cartoon bunnies who are on their way home on the night before their clan's yearly moon festival only to find out that the moon has decided to run away, and if Cookie and Cream aren't able to find it, there will never be another festival. Fearing this, the duo sets out to make sure that it doesn't come true.</p>\n<p><em>The Adventures of Cookie &amp; Cream</em> is designed for cooperative gameplay with two players. The goal of each level is to get to the end in a limited amount of time. \nThere is basically a straight road from A to B where the players have to overcome obstacles in their way. This includes standard platforming or puzzles which need both players to solve, e.g. one has to press a button so that the other can progress. Because the way is not the same for both characters the game uses a split-screen view. Power-ups increase the time limits but certain obstacles decrease it again if touched. There are overall 35 levels.</p>\n<p>It is possible to play the game alone but then the player has to control both characters at once. The game also features a unique 4-player mode where each character is controlled by two people and one joypad.</p>",

      '<p>A fighting game with characters taken from many Capcom and SNK games. The game system is centered around "grooves" which are selected before any battle. These different grooves alter the character\'s abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated to each company, and even the option to define a custom groove.</p>\n<p>The "EO" of the GameCube and Xbox titles refer to a new groove: Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character\'s move set can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases.</p>\n<p>Playable characters come from the following games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/9465/street-fighter/">Street Fighter</a> (Ryu, Ken, Eagle, Sagat)</li>\n<li><a href="/search/?q=Final+Fight">Final Fight</a> (Rolento)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6239/street-fighter-ii-the-world-warrior/">Street Fighter II</a> (Guile, Chun-Li, Blanka, Dhalsim, E.

The new version includes new music and artwork, more super arts for each character, a grading system, a manual throw system, path selection, and new characters including (YES!) Chun-Li. The Dreamcast port also offers a training record option where you can record a certain move or combo and have it play against you over and over to see how you can parry it, plus a "system direction" option which allows you to modify practically every aspect of the game (air-blocking, combo limits, etc.) to customize it to your liking.</p>\n<p>The game would later get an Online Edition port. Besides adding online multiplayer, the game also has HD-filtered graphics,, YouTube replay sharing, new art, a new Trials mode, and challenges which earn the player Vault Points, which is needed to unlock bonus materials.</p>',

The most significant is a new short scenario called <em>Born from a Wish</em>, where players take control of Maria from her first moments right up to where she first appears in the main game. Also included is a sixth ending to the main scenario and a minor feature that allows the player to turn off the graphical effect, which makes the game look like it was shot on cheap film stock.</p>',

      '<p>When the humans created artificial beings named "gears" in 22th century, they didn\'t expect that their creation will eventually turn against them. Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner.</p>\n<p><em>Guilty Gear X</em> is a follow up to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/18555/guilty-gear/"> Guilty Gear</a>, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you can perform. Beside special attacks which you can execute if you build up your Tension Gauge by attacking or advancing towards your opponent, there is also a variety of defensing moves to perform. The instant kill moves are back from the previous game.</p>',

      '<p>It is a time of war. Many leaders from different factions fight to control their land. One such leader, Liu Bei, has only one wish: peace. But war stands in his way, after his land Shu is attacked by the kingdom of Wei, led by the warlord Cao Cao, who abducts Liu Bei\'s beloved Diao Chan, the keeper of the Imperial Seal. Liu Bei has to flee, but swears to return, exact revenge on Cao Cao, and liberate the kingdom of Shu.</p>\n<p><em>Kessen II</em> is a real-time strategy game, and a follow-up to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/4241/kessen/">Kessen</a>. Unlike the first game, it is set in the Chinese Three Kingdoms period. The account of historical events is heavily fictionalized in the game, liberally adding new sub-plots (such as the entire romance angle of the story) and supernatural elements. The player can choose to command the armies of either Liu Bei or Cao Cao in their respective scenarios.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, the most notable change being the shift to supernatural warfare, including the addition of magical attacks such as tornadoes, lightning strikes, earthquakes, meteor showers, etc. The player can now control 500 units at one time, as opposed to 100 in the previous game. New unit types (elite horsemen, elephant cavalry, etc.) have been added.</p>',

      "<p>Legend has it that 2000 years ago in the depths of hell, a demon rebelled against the devil, waging a one-man war in support of the human world. </p>\n<p>In the present, Dante, a private investigator of the supernatural, realises that the devil is rallying to rise again against mankind. Deep within Dante's blood lies the power of ancient demons and as his power builds he transforms into a demon state where he can use his power against evil he encounters.</p>\n<p>Commencing his battle against the demonic legions with just a sword and his twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory, Dante will soon come across more powerful weapons, such as a shotgun to aid him in his mission. However, to defeat the devil Dante must also discover special weapons possessing various elemental powers. When channelled correctly these weapons will allow Dante to call upon demonic energy and launch powerful attacks against a range of enemies.</p>",

      "<p><em>Okage: Shadow King</em> is an RPG with a slight twist: it's humorous.</p>\n<p>The game's premise is that a boy (nameable by the player with the default name of Ari) makes a deal with an evil spirit to cure his sister of a curse that's caused her to speak entirely in pig Latin. The spirit, Evil King Stanley Hihat Trinidad XIV (or Stan for short), assumes the role of your shadow and orders you to track down the lost remnants of his power, which have been siphoned away by impostor Evil Kings over the last few thousand years while he was trapped in a bottle. And, while you're at it, Stan would also like you to help him take over the world.</p>\n<p>The game plays similarly to most JRPGs. Ari will visit towns and fight (turn based) battles against monsters - which in this game happen to be things like wild cows and man eating onions. Party members level up and gain new skills as they gain experience. Ari can respond to the story and other characters with a number of different dialogue options, such as a nice response, a rude response, or a silly response, and how he acts will affect how different party members feel about him.</p>",

Carter can interview suspects and open locked doors; Andre uses a special Omnitool to repair broken equipment or machinery; Minoko can hack into computer terminals, accessing information and controlling cannons, robots, tanks, and other machines; Amber can shoot pulse laser bolts and missiles, and is unaffected by hazards such as flames, poison gas, electricity, cold temperatures, etc.</p>\n<p>Problem-solving in the game often involves cooperation between characters.

      "<p>Ico is a boy with horns. At the age of twelve, when his horns grew large enough, the elders send him away to be sacrificed in order to prevent evil spirits from attacking the village. Entombed in a crumbling ancient castle, Ico only manages to begin his escape when a freak earthquake shakes loose the vessel he has been locked in. Ico shortly meets a princess named Yorda, who has been imprisoned by the evil queen. The two children must explore the ominous castle, trying to find a way to escape, persecuted by the queen's shadow minions.</p>\n<p><em>ICO</em> is a third-person perspective game that mixes action-based exploration gameplay with puzzles. The game is set almost exclusively in the castle, which consists of dozens of rooms, passages, platforms, and contraptions. Ico will run, climb, and jump his way through these environments. The puzzles in the game are physical (environmental): Ico must push and pull objects, manipulate switches, re-arrange structures, etc. </p>\n<p>Yorda will accompany Ico throughout most of the game. Many of the puzzles revolve around creating a way for Yorda to access special glowing blue doors, which only she is capable of unlocking with her powers. Being less athletic than Ico, Yorda will often need a more comfortable path built for her. Ico can hold Yorda's hand to lead her with him, and also call her to come nearer. </p>\n<p>With the exception of the final (and only) boss, all the enemies in the game are shadows. They attack in groups, either at pre-set points, or when Ico is separated from Yorda for a long time. Their goal is always the same: to capture Yorda and carry her towards a black whirlpool. If the player fails to rescue her before she is consumed by this shadow portal, the game is over. Conversely, Ico can not be killed by the shadows; they can only push him, preventing him from reaching Yorda in time. The player must therefore fend off the shadows (Ico uses a stick for the largest portion of the game), at the same time hurrying towards Yorda. Protecting and rescuing Yorda is one of the primary gameplay elements in <em>ICO</em>.</p>\n<p>The game has no HUD (heads-up display). Other distinguishing features are the soft lightning visual style, low-key use of in-game music, and conversations through a fictional language, leaving much to the player's imagination.</p>",

      "<p>Monster raising and creature contests move into the 128-bit generation as the popular Tecmo series sets up shop on the PlayStation 2 in this release of Monster Rancher 3. Though many characters and places are recognizable from earlier releases in the series, monsters in this game are represented in a cel-shaded cartoon style, similar to that of the Dreamcast's Jet Grind Radio or the contemporary PS2 release Yanya Caballista featuring Gawoo. </p>\n<p>The game receives improved graphics and some additional features with its move to the more powerful PS2 console. Most of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version. Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs. While some aspects of creation are random, certain albums and movies may generate creatures specifically related to the artistic content on the disk. </p>",
