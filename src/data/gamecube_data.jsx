      '<p><em>Resident Evil 3</em> takes place during the events of <a href="/search/?q=Biohazard+2">Resident Evil 2</a>. The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. The player must guide Jill "master of unlocking" Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original <a href="/search/?q=%0A4976219154468">Resident Evil</a>) out of the city alive. Along the way, Jill will interact with and receive help from (or be hindered by) three Umbrella mercenaries who are also stranded in Raccoon City. Standing in the way of your group\'s last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, including Jill.</p>\n<p>A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis can run (faster than Jill, in fact), use firearms (a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we\'ve come to know from Umbrella\'s ultimate bio-weapons. </p>\n<p>Like its two predecessors <em>Resident Evil 3</em> is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by <a href="/search/?q=alone+In+the+Dark">Alone in the Dark</a>. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, the gameplay is improved by features such as auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows Jill to avoid enemy attacks. Another addition is Jill\'s ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. The game include a randomization feature, which changes the location of certain key items and ammo. Another noteworthy feature is that at certain points in the game, Jill is faced with two choices for a situation, each will affect later story, and even the game ending. The zombies have also been made more diverse.</p>\n<p>The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for <em>Resident Evil 2</em>). Another addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation.</p>\n<p>The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill\'s possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.</p>',

      "<p><em>Super Bust-A-Move</em> is a real-time puzzle game similar to its predecessors in the <em>Bust-A-Move</em> series. It adds a new multiplayer mode and features graphical enhancements.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game, as with the previous titles in the series, is to remove a collected number of coloured bubbles from the game screen. To do so, at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the coloured bubbles from a launcher, sending the bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or more together of the same colour to clear them from the screen. If you're too slow, the collection of bubbles moves down the screen towards you, and the game will end if it reaches the bottom.</p>\n<p>Classic mode features a number of bubble puzzles previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while Normal mode has some new variations on the bubble removing theme. Two players can also compete against each other.</p>",

    description:
      "<p><em>Crazy Taxi</em> is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks, and even underwater, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the color represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. </p>\n<p>In the main Arcade mode, there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token, the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.</p>\n<p>Next to the Arcade mode, there is an Original mode and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed-down courses. In the regular modes, it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race, the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B, or A, with S for outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version, there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers' different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</p>",

      "<p><em>Star Wars</em> is a first-person shooter based around the final scenes of the original <em>Star Wars</em> film. It first appeared for arcade coin-operated machines and was subsequently converted to other gaming platforms.</p>\n<p>You take on the role of Luke Skywalker, aiming to destroy the Death Star. In the first phase you have to pass swarms of TIE Fighters, including dogfighting the one piloted by Darth Vader himself. In the second phase the station's surface is protected by laser towers, third involves attacking its weakest spot - the unprotected exhaust port - with proton torpedos. Your X-Wing starts with six shields, but more can be awarded for good performance. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty.</p>\n<p>The game uses vector graphics, which allow lots of action at high speed on comparatively slow systems.</p>",

      '<p>A port of the arcade game, <em>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</em> is the follow-up to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3590/gauntlet-legends/">Gauntlet: Legends</a> and another installment in the long-running <a href="/search/?q=Gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the <em>Gauntlet</em> games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never-ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. </p>\n<p>This version contains the characters and levels from <em>Gauntlet: Legends</em>, plus the new characters and levels from the <em>Dark Legacy</em> arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.</p>\n<p>There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you\'ll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there is some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. </p>\n<p>Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird\'s eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the gameplay is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.</p>\n<p>While levels can be gained and characters saved, <em>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</em> is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.</p>',

      "<p><em>XGIII: Extreme G Racing</em> is a futuristic racing game. Six teams are competing to win a racing championship, the player taking control of any of the two riders available in each team. The game retains the action elements of the previous titles: as before, opponents will try to sabotage the race, and the player-controlled character is able to answer them with his own arsenal of weapons.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous installments, weapons cannot be picked up on the road: the player has to purchase them with the money earned after a successful race. All weapons now deplete the player's weapon bar with each shot. Another change is the absence of the \"nitro\" boosts utilized in the previous entries; they have been replaced with a turbo system, where using the boost drains energy from the player character's shields.</p>",

      '<p>A fighting game with characters taken from many Capcom and SNK games. The game system is centered around "grooves" which are selected before any battle. These different grooves alter the character\'s abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated to each company, and even the option to define a custom groove.</p>\n<p>The "EO" of the GameCube and Xbox titles refer to a new groove: Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character\'s move set can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases.</p>\n<p>Playable characters come from the following games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/9465/street-fighter/">Street Fighter</a> (Ryu, Ken, Eagle, Sagat)</li>\n<li><a href="/search/?q=Final+Fight">Final Fight</a> (Rolento)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6239/street-fighter-ii-the-world-warrior/">Street Fighter II</a> (Guile, Chun-Li, Blanka, Dhalsim, E.

      "<p>Based on the cartoon series rather the comic books or the movies, <em>Batman: Vengeance</em> puts you in the role of the 'Dark Knight' in a 3D Gotham City, in order to face and fight enemies; such as Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, and, yes, The Joker.</p>\n<p>The Joker has died after falling from a bridge mid-scuffle with our caped hero. With the big man's place at the top of the criminal hierarchy up for grabs, the city's most heinous villains are out in force, clambering over each other for the new employment opportunity. Batman's most dangerous opponents are causing a crime wave the likes of which Gotham has never seen. Nothing is as it seems. You can't even be sure that the infamous Joker has really ceased to exist. Gotham's safety hangs in the balance and only Batman can save it.</p>",

      '<p><em>SSX Tricky</em> is <a href="/search/?q=Electronic+Arts">EA</a>\'s follow up to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3570/ssx/">SSX</a>. Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC\'s "It\'s Tricky" to play. </p>\n<p>Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include "behind-the-scenes" footage and a "making of" segment.</p>',

It incorporates several modes of play, a variety of racers, customization options, and tracks. Players can race in four tournament cup series, compete in time attack mode against the best track times, compete for points in stunt mode, and simply take in the eye-poppingly beautiful graphics in Free Roam mode. Multiplay is supported in Stunt and Race modes. There are a total of eight racers to choose from, each with a different balance in engine and handling. Customization is limited, but players can change the color of their racer, optimize the engine for either acceleration or speed, and optimize handling to be either tight or loose. However, settings have little effect on the racer's actual performance.\nThere are eight different courses, however, there are a total of 19 racing tracks laid out across these courses, plus one stunt track for each course. Also, there are five different weathers, consisting of Sunny, Partially Sunny, Light Rain, Rain, and Stormy. These weathers can have dramatic effects on tracks, making a track raced in Sunny weather totally different when raced in Stormy weather conditions.\nThe AI is fairly well balanced, but will cheat to stay with a player.</p>",

      "<p>Luigi's Mansion pits you as Luigi, Mario's forgotten brother.</p>\n<p>Luigi, while checking his mail, found out he won a mansion in a contest. What's weird, is he never entered any contest to begin with. Being the curious person he is, he calls up his brother, Mario, and asks to meet him at the house.</p>\n<p>Luigi sets forth through a dark and scary jungle to find the house, but sees that Mario is nowhere to be found. Puzzled, Luigi enters the mansion, only to encounter ghosts. He meets up with a scientist, Professor E. Gadd, who explains the situation and hands over the Poltergust 3000. Luigi must now make his way through the mansion's many rooms, sucking up as many ghosts as he can.</p>\n<p>As you explore, you must solve mysteries, collect cash/gems/jewels/coins, and encounter boss characters. Luigi's vacuum has the ability to suck up ghosts that have inhabited this strange mansion. However, the ghosts will not give up so easily. You must struggle with them and pull them back to catch your prey with your trusty vacuum. As you continue to your goal, you must face off with the deceased denizens of the house and the boos that haunt it, and unlock new rooms with the keys you find along the way. You can also gain special abilities for your vacuum, such as the ability to shoot fire, water, or ice. Remember though, treasure is scattered everywhere. Check all the objects for coins and paper money, and who knows, you may just make enough money for Luigi to buy a mansion of his own...</p>\n<p>As you explore the strange mansion, the plot slowly unravels and it becomes apparent that something more sinister is going on in that haunted house. Will you ever see your lost brother Mario again? </p>\n<p>The 3DS version has some difference from the Gamecube original. Changes include coins lasting longer before disappearing after being hit, the addition of local co-op with another player being able to control a character named Gooigi, a new control option that allows the use of the Strobulb flashlight from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/65031/luigis-mansion-dark-moon/\"> Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon </a>, an achievement list, and a boss rush mode, among other tweaks. The 3DS version Hidden Mansion follows the adjustments made in the Gamecube's PAL version</p>",

You are tasked with reaching the goal in each level by tilting the playing field, resulting in your monkey "rolling" forward or backward. Several obstacles lay in between your monkey and the goal, and a time limit means you can never spend too long on a given level. Bananas are found across the levels, which both contribute to your score and grant an extra life per 100 collected.</p>\n<p>The three main difficulty levels are Beginner, Advanced, and Expert, each of which offers more maps to play and a greater challenge. EX and Master levels are unlocked by performing well on these maps. A Competition mode allows multiple players to play these levels simultaneously on a split screen.</p>\n<p>There are also various mini-games for you to unlock, such as Monkey Billiards and Monkey Bowling.</p>',

      "<p><em>Rayman Arena/Rayman M</em> is the first multiplayer game in the Rayman series. It's not a platformer like earlier games of the Rayman franchises but a race and arena battle game. The game is divided in five leagues (beginner, advanced, expert, extreme and bonus). The first four have each three racing tracks and three arenas that increase in difficulty.</p>\n<p>The racing mode is split in four different race types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Training: for exploration and practice of the racecourse and setting personal records;</li>\n<li>Race: up to four different characters race each other over several rounds with the first one crossing the finish line winning;</li>\n<li>Popolopoï: one must reach the finish line before time runs out. Time can be replenished by shooting some kind of butterflies called Popolopoï and no opponents are to be beaten;</li>\n<li>Lums: over three laps, a certain amount of Lums have to be collected and one must beat the other opponents to the finish line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The arena battle mode is split in three different battle types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lum Spring: the first to collect five Lums/crystals or the one with the most Lums when time runs out wins. Ice bullets can be fired at an opponent to temporarily freeze them and beat them to the Lum;</li>\n<li>Lum Fight: all players start with five hit points each that need to be shot off with weapons found around the arena. A point is scored if a player shoots off the last hit point of another player. The first to reach a certain amount of points or the one with the most points when time runs out wins. When killed through one’s own actions, a negative point is scored;</li>\n<li>Capture the Fly: the goal is to find and capture a Light-Fly.

      '<p><em>Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex</em> is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original PlayStation. The story is set sometime after <a href="/search/?q=Bandicoot+Warped">Warped</a>: Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. Crunch\'s power source is a set of magical masks known as the Elementals, each representing a different element, including Earth, Water, Fire, and Ice. The warp room splits levels into their respective elements, with the boss of each section being a battle against Crunch influenced by the Elemental mask of said section. </p>\n<p>The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.</p>',

      '<p>The sequel to HAL Laboratory\'s <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3546/super-smash-bros/">Super Smash Bros.</a>, which pitted Nintendo characters against each other, ups the ante by including more levels, more characters, and more game modes.</p>\n<p>The game is a Nintendo fighting game with different rules to it. Instead of knocking your opponent\'s health down, you knock him or her out of the battle field. You choose from the wealth of Nintendo characters like Mario, Bowser, Yoshi, different Pokémon, and even Link and then either fight through the single-player portion, featuring modes like Classic, Adventure, and Event Mode or battle it out with your friends in a four-player frenzy. More characters and stages are unlocked as hidden objectives are met, and coins rewarded for playing in all modes can be spent on a capsule toy machine. The toys in the machine represent games from Nintendo\'s entire video game history, and each can be viewed in 3D with a brief description. Also, with the simplified fighting controls, it\'s pretty easy for even your non-gaming friends to just pick-up and play.</p>\n<p>Playable characters come from the following games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/890/game-watch-series/">Game &amp; Watch</a> (Mr. Game &amp; Watch)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/574/donkey-kong/">Donkey Kong</a> (Donkey Kong)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/7301/mario-bros/">Mario Bros.</a> (Mario, Luigi)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/7298/super-mario-bros/">Super Mario Bros.</a> (Princess Peach, Bowser)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/7303/metroid/">Metroid</a> (Samus)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3393/the-legend-of-zelda/">The Legend of Zelda</a> (Link)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/8544/ice-climber/">Ice Climber</a> (Ice Climbers)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6116/dr-mario/">Dr. Mario</a> (Dr. Mario)</li>\n<li><a href="/search/?q=Fire+Emblem">Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryū to Hikari no Tsurugi</a> (Marth)</li>\n<li><a href="/search/?q=F-Zero">F-Zero</a> (Captain Falcon)</li>\n<li><a href="/search/?q=Super+Mario+World">Super Mario World</a> (Yoshi)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/5335/kirbys-dream-land/">Kirby\'s Dream Land</a> (Kirby)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6629/star-fox/">Star Fox</a> (Fox, Falco)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6676/earthbound/">Earthbound</a> (Ness)</li>\n<li><a href="/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+Red">Pokémon Red</a>/<a href="/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+Blue">Blue</a> (Pikachu, Jigglypuff, Mewtwo)</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3549/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> (Young Link, Princess Zelda/Shiek, Ganondorf)</li>\n<li><a href="/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+Gold">Pokémon Gold</a>/<a href="/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+Silver">Silver</a> (Pichu)</li>\n<li><a href="/search/?q=Fire+Emblem:+Fuuin+no+Tsurugi">Fire Emblem: Fuuin no Tsurugi</a> (Roy)</li>\n</ul>',

The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world. Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch. Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries. Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon's hands. So James Bond sets off on another adventure...</p>\n<p>The game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.</p>",

      "<p><em>Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance</em> is an action RPG which casts the player as one of three basic characters: an elf sorceress, a human archer, or a dwarf fighter. From humble beginnings slaying rats in the cellars of an inn, the adventurer will move on to exploring caves, crypts, and mountain passes. Naturally, it's all filled to the brim with horrible monsters, wicked traps, treasures, and fabled magical weapons. As the game progresses, the player is constantly rewarded with new weaponry, new monsters to fight, and experience points to put into the adventurer's character stats to grow even more powerful. The adventurer must eventually unravel the secrets of a dark, new Thieves Guild backed by powerful mages.</p>",

      "<p>Following the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2207/blood-omen-legacy-of-kain/\">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen</a>, the vampire Kain has assembled an army of vampires to take over the world of the humans. Fighting across Nosgoth, his goal is to make his way to the great city of Meridian and take control of this stronghold. However, upon reaching the gates of the city, the army is challenged by the Serafan Order, an organized force of vampire hunters and its leader, the magical Serafan lord. Kain engages the Serafan lord in single combat, is struck down and defeated. Kain's sword, the Soul Reaver, is claimed by his enemy. Unconscious for 200 years, Kain awakes under the care of the vampire Umah to a world he barely recognizes. Following the defeat of Kain's army, the vampires have been hunted down by the Serafan and only a few remain. The city of Meridian is ruled under martial law by the Serafan Order, which is very oppressive towards its citizens. Strange glyph magic is used to power machines and fuel industry and at the same time is deadly to vampires and used as wards throughout the city. Kain swears revenge on the one who defeated him and seeks to reclaim his place as the ruler of the vampires.</p>\n<p><em>The Legacy of Kain Series: Blood Omen 2</em> is a third person action game with adventure elements, more similar in perspective to <a href=\"/search/?q=Soul+Reaver\">Soul Reaver</a> than the first <em>Blood Omen</em> game. The player views the environment from behind Kain's shoulder, moving him in different directions, attacking, jumping, using dark gifts, and grabbing on to ledges. Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform stealth kills which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands or by picking up daggers, swords, axes, and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and may also be thrown at enemies from afar.</p>\n<p>The Serafan Order uses glyph magic, partially because it is deadly to vampires. Kain will often encounter areas where he is barred from progressing because of glyph barriers and must find a way around them. Additionally, glyphs function similar to electricity in that they power machines and switches. Many of the puzzles featured in <em>Blood Omen 2</em> involve needing to create a glyph circuit in order to deliver power to a specific point. Glyph energy glows as it travels down its path, allowing the player to see exactly where the energy spark is.</p>",

      '<p><em>Worms Blast</em> is a puzzle game similar in concept to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/80760/puzzle-bobble/">Puzzle Bobble</a>, with several important distinctions and gameplay features taken from <em>Worms</em> games. Instead of releasing and matching bubbles, the player has to color blocks on a hexagonal grid. Unlike most <a href="/search/?q=Bust-A-Move">Bust-A-Move</a> variants, the player character can move right and left, sailing in a boat. Various weapons, such as bazooka, grenades, dynamite, and others, can be used to fire at the blocks, coloring them on impact. Like in the main, artillery-based <em>Worms</em> games, holding down the fire button increases the power of the weapon, affecting the distance it travels. </p>\n<p>If the player hits a block that is either the same color as the missile fired, that block and any other same-colored blocks adjacent to it will be destroyed. Differently-colored blocks will not be affected by shooting at them; however, if they are held solely by a group of blocks of the same color, they will fall into the water when that group disappears. Blocks with rainbows on them can count as any color. Unlike <em>Puzzle Bobble</em>, there are no walls in single-player mode. If the player aims the weapon outside of the screen, a heavy object might fall on the player-controlled boat, damaging it.</p>\n<p>The game\'s main mode is called "Puzzle mode": the player completes various stages, the goal being different in each (e.g. shooting down certain forms of blocks, avoiding hostile blocks that move around the screen, etc.). Beside this mode, the game features a single-player tournament mode with high scores, as well as a variety of multiplayer modes. The action component is particularly noticeable in this mode, since the walls between the areas will periodically open, allowing players to use this opportunity to shoot at each other\'s boats.</p>',

      "<p><em>The Sum of all Fears</em> is a first person shooter game reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rogue+Spear\">Rogue Spear series</a>. It's from the same development team and the look and feel is alike, although it's not as tactical as Rogue Spear. </p>\n<p>The game's story is built around the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tom+Clancy\">Tom Clancy</a> book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included.</p>\n<p>Unlike Rogue Spear, you can't choose team members or equipment, it's all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades . You can't make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other shooter games, you can't survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you then can switch to another team member.</p>",

There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups. However, they are not based on real makes and models.</p>\n<p>One notable feature of Burnout is the "Burn Meter." The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic or power-drifting through corners. Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost. If you crash, however, the Burn Meter is reset and must be filled again to achieve a boost.</p>',

Small statistics are shown for every country - their last biggest win, appearances at the World Cup, etc.</p>\n<p>The stadium and all players are really detailed. The player's texture's resolution is so high, you can easily recognize most of them. The stadium is big and impressive and full of colored crowd.</p>\n<p>As in <em>FIFA Soccer 2002</em>, the animation was taken from real players, with motion sensors. Thus, some new animation was added - new sliding, falling, and more.</p>\n<p>And the newest feature of <em>2002 FIFA World Cup</em>, is the air ball control model. You can take balls from the air, and have much more control with them - creating great goals from the air.</p>",

As the Fog approaches the kingdom of Argwyll, its king embarks on a journey to find a way to stop it - a journey he does not return from. His daughter Katia finds a powerful runestone, which grants her the magical ability to summon and control monsters. Armed with this new power, Katia sets off to find out what happened to her father, and ultimately what can be done to stop the impending catastrophe.</p>\n<p><em>Lost Kingdoms</em> is an RPG with a somewhat unusual card-based battle system. Katia cannot fight herself; the fighting is done by monsters she summons. The battle process is done in real-time, like in action games; the player must be quick to navigate Katia away from danger and summon the monsters. Monsters of various types are represented as cards. When the player chooses a card, the monster will appear and perform an attack. Depending on the card type, the monster will just perform a quick attack, replace Katia for a while, or even stay on the battle field until defeated. Katia receives new cards upon defeating enemies; she can also subdue monsters and turn them into cards as well. Special shops will sell new cards and make new ones out of the old ones Katia can offer to them.</p>",

Bomberman has been given the task of taking back a powerful element of magic and protecting it from the hands of evil. To do so, he must use his bombing abilities to blast his way through mazes filled with crazy enemies and hidden secrets. There are 5 worlds in all, each with 16 levels to complete. And after completing certain objectives and picking up items, Bomberman will learn new techniques and abilities to improve his range with his bombs or use new weapons.</p>\n<p>Also included is a 4 player classic Bomberman multiplayer modes. Unlike the adventure mode, all of the multi-player modes are set in the original 2D, top-down style perspective. The last man standing wins in most rounds, with the added twist of other enemies on screen and timed battles.</p>",

The game has a bad attitude chock full of sexual themes and language that puts Happy Gilmore to shame.</p>\n<p><em>Outlaw Golf</em> pits you as one of ten over-the-top golfing personalities (paired with equally over-the-top caddies) to compete in over 30 different tour events from where you attempt to unlock new characters, better clubs and balls as well as improving your golfer's skills along the way with 12 different mini-games. The game also sports a composure response system, which simply means that when you do well, the game is easier and when you aren't doing so well you will find your shots not going exactly where you want them. Composure too low? Beat up your caddy and you can relieve some of that stress to regain your lost composure. Multiplayer supports 8 different game modes, including stroke play, match play, skins, best ball and casino with up to four players.</p>",

      '<p>You have been chosen to join the reckoning—you are to step into the World of Darkness where humanity is ravaged by vampires and marauding monsters. As a Hunter, you are immune to these beasts\' illusions, but with your power comes a daunting destiny: to destroy these evil beings before mankind is massacred.</p>\n<p><em>Hunter</em> takes place over 23 different stages in which you and up to three of your friends can wield up to twenty different weapons against a horde of enemies. Each player chooses from one of four classes: the Avenger, Martyr, Defender, or Judge. Each one possesses different strengths and weaknesses along with their own individual set of spells. Gameplay can very much be compared to the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/371/gauntlet-series/">Gauntlet games</a>, where you face innumerable odds while building up your own characters in order to take down the ultimate evil.</p>',

      "<p><em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</em> is a psychological thriller epic starring the adventures of twelve characters that span across the world and two millennia. From time immemorial the forces of evil from beyond have been trying to manifest themselves in our world, and it is only through the actions of these forgotten heroes that the world has been saved from being overrun. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword and gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.</p>\n<p>The game features an involved Magick system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.</p>\n<p><em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</em> also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items. Aside from this, characters also have health and mana meters.</p>",

      "<p>Midway's first extreme sports title that tackles the great American past-time... baseball.  Take control of all of your favorite Major League Baseball teams and players armed with all of their real stats, attributes, abilities and attitude.  Slugfest features many playable minigames, a season mode, quick play and exhibition play.</p>\n<p>So what makes MLB Slugfest extreme?  The game is far from a real baseball simulation.  This is as arcade as it gets.  Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low.</p>\n<p>Graphic touches include real player faces and details such as chewing gum and talking to teammates or opponents.  Real stadiums all make their appearances along with several fantasy stadiums that can be unlocked.</p>",

The game doesn\'t use a hard time limit but the so-called "juice meter": it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game, you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a "learning by doing" approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level that open up new areas within the level.</p>\n<p>10 pro inline skaters join the fun (<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/84320/shane-yost/">Shane Yost</a>, <a href="/search/?q=Sam+Fogarty">Sam Fogarty</a>, <a href="/search/?q=Sven+Boekhorst">Sven Boekhorst</a>, <a href="/search/?q=Eito+Yasuko">Eito Yasuko</a> and more), and you can take on a friend in 2 player split screen.</p>',

New features in NCAA Football for the 2003 season include over 200 licensed fight songs, 3D cheerleaders and 144 different schools.</p>\n<p>Dynasty mode has been enhanced with the ability to redshirt a player and schedule your non-conference games before each season. In Dynasty Mode you can win all the real trophies to add to your own personal collection which you can show off later. These awards include the Heisman, Coach of the Year and Bowl-specific trophies. You can also win special trophies for winning certain rivalry games, which is another new play mode in 2003. There are 23 different "Rivalry" trophies for you to earn to go alongside your Dynasty trophies. </p>\n<p>Create-A-School mode makes it into this edition, letting you create your own football team. Everything from the logos on the field to your school\'s fight song can be customized. Your created team can be played in Exhibition play or imported into Dynasty mode.</p>\n<p>The last notable feature new to NCAA Football 2003 is the customizable interface. You choose your favorite team and the game interface will be based around your team\'s fight song, mascot, logos and school colors.</p>',

Upon arrival, however, they discover the island has been polluted causing its energy source, the Shine Sprites, to disappear. The culprit is similar in appearance to Mario, who is blamed for the mess, so the portly plumber is forced to clean up the island. Mario is given an invention called FLUDD (a backpack with several water nozzles) to help him clean up graffiti and mud and capture the real villain. Gameplay features a combination of action and puzzle solving, with numerous stages and multiple episodes to each stage, and plenty of hidden secrets and surprises.</p>",

      '<p><em>Dead to Rights</em> is a 3rd-person shooter in which the player is Jack Slate, a police officer in Grant City. On a routine call, he finds the dead body of his father. While trying to find the murderer, he is framed for another murder. Jack becomes a fugitive; his run from the law will take him to various places, from strip joints and hotels to office complexes, and even prison, as an inmate.</p>\n<p>When controlling Jack, players can perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, or tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion. If Jack does not have a gun drawn, he can disarm an enemy which causes him to steal the enemy\'s gun, then performing some sort of finish, such as a neck breaker. Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as the game progresses.</p>\n<p>Players will sometimes have to control Jack\'s best friend and partner, his K-9 dog Shadow, which allows enemies to be killed from a distance. In addition, Shadow will fetch their guns and bring them to Jack.</p>\n<p>The game also features "adrenaline combat", similar to "Bullet Time" from <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/4529/max-payne/">Max Payne</a>. Jack will then perform slow-motion dives and spins, giving him an advantage, as long as his adrenaline meter holds out.</p>',

      "<p>The object of Super Monkey Ball 2 is to guide a monkey trapped inside a plastic ball through a maze to the goal. There are three variations, story mode, challenge mode, and practice mode. In story mode you have unlimited number of tries to complete a stage, and after clearing 10 stages a movie clip is shown followed by a new world of 10 stages. In challenge mode, you have a limited number of monkeys and a time limit to complete numerous levels of increasing difficulty. In practice mode you can play any stage already completed in the other two modes. In addition to the main game options, numerous party games are also included. These are monkey race, monkey fight, monkey target, monkey billiards, monkey bowling, monkey golf, monkey boat, monkey shot, monkey dogfight, monkey soccer, monkey baseball, and monkey tennis. The party games can be played by one to four players.</p>",

It is now up to Fox McCloud and his team to save the planet and destroy the evil army.</p>\n<p><em>Star Fox Adventures</em> breaks away from the previous games in the series, being an action game with light puzzle-solving elements, similar to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3549/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/">Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>. You control Fox McCloud as he adventures through Dinosaur Planet, but at the beginning, you control the female fox Krystal, whom McCloud must later rescue. There are missions where you use your trusty Arwing craft, but the majority of the game takes place on foot.</p>\n<p>Helping you throughout your adventure are your trusty sidekicks; Peppy, Slippy, and ROB the Robot, who guide and give you mission briefings. To aid Fox throughout the game, a variety of weapons and magical items are available from blasters to grenades to magic staffs. You may also purchase items with "scarabs", the game\'s currency. Throughout the game you may partake in various mini-games, which are found at different stores.</p>',

      "<p>The perfect hitman, Agent 47, tries to distance himself from his violent past and becomes a humble church gardener. But he is tricked into returning to his trade when his friend, a priest, gets kidnapped by an Italian mafioso. \n<em>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</em> is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives. </p>\n<p>Typically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards. </p>\n<p>The guards aren't completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they'll react if they see you waving around a gun. They'll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they'll eventually realize you're not one of their buddies. </p>\n<p><em>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</em> brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a \"Mass Murderer\", while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the \"Silent Assassin\" rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion.</p>",

      "<p>Do you like to surf? Have you ever imagined surfing at different remote locations around the world? Well, Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it's easy to jump into the game and surf. </p>\n<p><strong>Game Play Modes:</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>Infinite Time</strong> - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy the surf. </p>\n<p><strong>High Score</strong> - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get?</p>\n<p><strong>Icon Challenge</strong> - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out.</p>\n<p><strong>Career Mode</strong> - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer Modes:</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>Push</strong> - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to \"push\" the split screen towards their opponent's half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to Head</strong> - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points when the time runs out.</p>\n<p><strong>Time Attack</strong> - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is alloted to your opponent.</p>\n<p>The Pros in the game: Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters.</p>\n<p>The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.</p>\n<p>The PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4.</p>",

      '<p>In the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3501/summoner/">previous game</a> the summoner Joseph became the god Urath, reborn by uniting the eight rings of summoning. Joseph’s culture hated the goddess Laharah and called her the “goddess of death.”</p>\n<p>This sequel takes place twenty years later in the realms of Halassar, Galdyr and Munari City which are across the world. You play Maia, who is the incarnate of the goddess Laharah and the powerful Queen of the realm of Halassar. Unlike Joseph’s kinship, Maia’s people worship Laharah as a benevolent creator. Maia was born with the mark of prophecy, her fate being written in the Book of Prophecy. From the beginning, she has welcomed her destiny and knows that she must fulfill the prophecy. What is unknown to her is the path she must follow to do so.</p>\n<p><em>Summoner 2</em> abandons the combo-based real-time combat of the predecessor and is more action-oriented, with the player directly controlling the physical attacks of the main character. Instead of summoning creatures to fight side-by-side with Maia, she actually becomes the demon when it is summoned. Three characters can be part of Maia’s party at one time and AI scripts can be assigned to each. Different characters are introduced as the story progresses and Maia’s skills improve. It is also possible to choose to adventure in “solo-mode”, leaving the party members behind to go on alone.</p>',

Many gameplay features remain as before.</p>\n<p>With the use of DVD technology, actual video footage of Mat and the crew was taken from their recent road trip and put into the game to give you a feeling of actually being there with them. Flatland tricks are another new addition. Also, there is the ability to tweak almost any stunt.</p>\n<p><strong>Single Player Modes:</strong>\n<strong>Session</strong> - Take some extra time to practice your tricks and routines in 2, 5, or 10 minute sessions on any of the levels that are unlocked. Scores can be saved to be put into the Hall of Fame.</p>\n<p><strong>Free Ride</strong> - Like Session, you can use this mode to practice your skills but with unlimited time. Since any score you get for a trick is replaced by the points of the next trick, no scores can be saved.</p>\n<p><strong>Road Trip</strong> - This is where you take the trip with the guys to go around and compete around the country. Within each level, there are goals to reach to improve your skills, unlock new levels, unlock bikes, and secrets in the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer Modes:</strong>\n<strong>Trick Attack</strong> - Compete against each other in a split screen competition to get the highest score you can in a certain amount of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Free Ride</strong> - Ride around showing off your stuff to your opponent.</p>\n<p><strong>Graffiti War</strong> - Ride around and find the Spray Cans in the level. Once you find them, perform a trick on the terrain. Once a stunt is completed, your opponent\'s screen will be "painted". The opponent can perform a higher scoring trick to clear the paint.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag</strong> - The person that is "it" is the only one that can score points. Be the first to find the red ring to be it. While you\'re it, score as many points as you can. The person not it must track the other down and knock into them to be it. If the person that is it bails then the other person will become it.</p>\n<p><strong>H.O.R.S.E.</strong> - Just like the old game of HORSE for basketball. In this case you need to perform a higher scoring run to beat them for the letter. The one with the lower score with be given a letter. The first person to spell HORSE is the loser.</p>\n<p><strong>Treasure Hunt</strong> - Race against each other to find the Golden Condor. Getting the Condor is the only way to score points.</p>\n<p><strong>Half Pipe Hell</strong> - Up to 8 players can play HotSeat style. You must take turns tricking your way up a mountain of terraced half pipes. The only way to score is to climb to the top by transferring pipe to pipe.</p>\n<p><strong>Push</strong> - This is like Trick Attack, but as you score more and more points your opponent\'s screen will get smaller and smaller. The loser is the one that gets pushed all the way off the screen.</p>\n<p>The Pros in the game include Mat Hoffman, Joe Kowalski, Rick Thorne, Mike Escamilla, Simon Tabron, Kevin Robinson, Cory Nastazio, Ruben Alcantara, Seth Kimbrough, and Nate Wessel.</p>\n<p>The locations you get to go to are Oklahoma City, Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Boston, Los Angeles, Portland, and Hawaii.</p>\n<p>To enhance the game, there is also a park editor so that you can make your own dream areas to ride in.</p>\n<p>Exclusive to the XBox version, you get to be able to ride in London, UK and have an extra rider - Chad Kagy.</p>',

      "<p>There are things in the world that humanity should not know about, and things it must be protected from. It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.</p>\n<p>Rayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and submachine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appears to slow down.</p>",

The mutants must save Forge before the Sentinels can coax secrets from him that are capable of destroying all mutant-kind.</p>\n<p><em>X-Men: Next Dimension</em> is a fighting game in which the player can choose between up to twenty-four available characters. The game features an extensive combo system, including normal chains, air juggles, and air launchers. Beside the basic blocking system, characters have various counter-attacks available, specific to the type of attack the player is countering. In addition to standard attacks, the player can execute super attacks by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously. These include blasts or beams, some of which can stun an opponent, as well as physical attacks that have special effects. There are several different types of super attacks, each having four different levels of power.</p>\n<p>The stages are rendered in 3D; unlike in most fighting games, many stages consist of multiple screens. The player can choose to move between these screens; kicking the opponent out of the current screen also leads to a location change. </p>\n<p>Most of the versions include the following modes:<em> </em>Story Mode* - the player follows a scripted mode; only several of the characters are available to control.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Arcade Mode</em> - a one-player mode where the player fights against the AI in a series of ten matches.</li>\n<li><em>Versus Mode</em> - a two-player game for one-on-one combat.</li>\n<li><em>Survival Mode</em> - a one-player game where the player tests his skills against a never-ending series of enemies, achieving as many victories as possible with only one life bar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GameCube version contains two exclusive modes, Team and Practice. The Xbox version features an extra stage and the ability to play as Pyro.</p>",

      '<p>TimeSplitters 2, the sequel to <a href="/search/?q=Free+Radical+Design">Free Radical Design\'s</a> PlayStation 2 launch title, once again sends players hurtling through time, as they battle the malevolent TimeSplitters in ten unique time periods, from the Wild West to a futuristic space station, and everything in between.</p>\n<p>The game\'s story finds Cortez, the series\' hero, on a quest to discover the origins of the TimeSplitters, an enigmatic group that travels through time causing trouble for the good people of Earth. Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements.</p>\n<p>Depending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120).</p>\n<p>The Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI "bots" can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills.</p>',

      "<p><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</em> is the fourth game in Activision's skateboarding franchise.</p>\n<p>The main feature of this game is it's redesigned career mode. When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits. When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that. There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo. Miss a trick, and goal fails. Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.</p>\n<p>All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.</p>\n<p>The levels are been expanded and are huge. Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz.</p>\n<p>For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill. New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo. THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.</p>\n<p>The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one. The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</p>",

After the Battle of Geonosis, Anakin and Obi Wan are sent to patrol a dead part of Republic sector, until a massive Confederate fleet ambushes the strategically useless planet of Rhen Var. After this, Anakin, Obi Wan soon discover that there may be something darker behind the invasion of Rhen Var. They find out about the Dark Reaper, an evil and powerful Sith device that could harvest the power of the living and use it as a concentrated weapon. Now it is up to the Republic to prevent this weapon from ever activating and destroying the galaxy!</p>\n<p>The Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat. Whereas the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/5500/star-wars-rogue-squadron-ii-rogue-leader/">Rogue Squadron</a> series concentrated on aerial battles, The Clone Wars contains almost all ground battles. You must fight as Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and others throughout the game to prevent the Confederacy from gaining a deadly weapon. Multiplayer options are also included for up to four players with game types including deathmatch, conquest, and a co-op ground and vehicle survival mode.</p>',

The player takes the role of Jack Archer, an ace Veritech pilot in the SDF. His missions range from hunting down and destroying Zentraedi Lieutenants in destroyed cities to defending shuttles traveling through deep space wreckage fields. Characters from the show, voiced by the same actors who did the voices in the <em>Robotech</em> cartoon, will make cameo appearances throughout the game.</p>\n<p>As the game progresses Jack will gain access to new Veritech models, which have different stats but mostly the same abilities. In Fighter mode the Veritech can fire a rapid fire Gunpod bullets or homing missiles as well as drop a decoy pod that will attract enemy missiles. Guardian mode is slower than Fighter mode and loses the ability to drop decoy pods, but can aim Gunpod bullets, gains more powerful missiles, and can pick up mission critical items. Battloid mode can not fly or fire missiles, but can rapidly aim the Gunpod and automatically shoot down enemy missiles. Battloid can also go into sniper mode and hit enemies at a distance with a very powerful charged Gunpod shot. Each mode can be switched between instantly and whenever desired. Medals are awarded for achieving milestones in the game, such as shooting down enemy units or winning boss battles, and these can unlock new Veritech models, paint jobs, and arenas for two-player mode.</p>",

      "<p>Electronic Arts' first game based on the Lord of the Rings movies is an action game with classic beat'em up-style gameplay. Despite the title, it covers events from both the first and the second film in the trilogy.</p>\n<p>Players, choosing to control Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, must battle the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron in order to protect the Ring of Power and restore peace to Middle-earth. </p>\n<p>The player character moves through the levels, fighting hordes of Orcs, Goblins and other creatures with various attack and parrying moves. The more varied the attacks are and the less the player is hit, the more points are awarded for each kill. At the end of each level, kill points are accumulated and can be used to gain new abilities. Most of these are new attack moves, unleashed through various button combinations. Others increase health or upgrade the strength or speed of existing attacks. Each of the three characters has unique upgrades and moves.</p>\n<p>Several levels feature boss battles with the likes of the Watcher of Moria or Lurtz, leader of the Uruk-hai. Each boss requires a unique strategy to defeat.</p>\n<p>Most combat scenes from the movies have been turned into levels for the game: from the confrontation with the Ringwraiths at the Weathertop and the battle in the Mines of Moria from the first film to fights with Warg-riders and other enemies on the plains of Rohan from the second film. The game culminates in the defense of Helm's Deep, even though the depiction of the battle in the game differs considerably from that in the film.</p>\n<p>Between the levels, cutscenes tell the story. These scenes combine actual film footage with footage rendered with the game engine.</p>\n<p>The game offers lots of bonus content, some of which must be unlocked by completing missions or reaching certain levels with the characters. Featured are interviews with the filmmakers and actors (who also provide voices for the game) as well as various making-of features.</p>",

Your own black bullets damage white enemies twice as much as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties make a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast. </p>\n<p>This aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.</p>',

      '<p><em>Resident Evil: Zero</em> takes place before the events of the original <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1195/resident-evil/">Resident Evil</a>. You take on the role as one of two characters; Rebecca Chambers, the Bravo team medic encountered in the first game, and Billy Coen, an ex-con being transported. The game begins with the Bravo team flying overhead, en route to investigate a series of murders. Something happens, and the helicopter crashes. Everyone survives, but when they all start searching, they encounter an overturned military transport truck, with nothing but corpses inside. Rebecca Chambers, the youngest member of S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team, goes to investigate the Umbrella Company Luxury Train, which has mysteriously stalled in the middle of the woods. You now take control of Rebecca, and your journey begins.</p>\n<p>In addition to the series\' traditional survival horror gameplay, the game introduces what it calls a "partner zapping" system, which allows you to switch between Rebecca and Billy at any time. This feature must be used at times, as the game requires both characters to work together to solve some puzzles. New to the game are a bunch of terrifying enemies, like the mutant centipede, new areas to explore, and the ability to drop items on the ground instead of having to find an item box.</p>\n<p>Unlike the original GameCube release, all enhanced ports later on feature an additional Wesker mode which gets unlocked after completing the game. That mode adds two new costumes, a red-eye controlled Rebecca look and a Wesker look for Billy with certain special abilities for Wesker. Both skins seem to have been based on Wesker and Jill from <em>Resident Evil 5</em> which came after the GameCube release of this game.</p>',
