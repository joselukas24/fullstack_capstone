      '<p>After the award-winning <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/827/nhl-98/">NHL 98</a>, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one of the most complete ice hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.</p>\n<p>Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.</p>\n<p>As graphic changes aren\'t enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jágr, Fedorov and Selänne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a "Brett Hull". For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.</p>\n<p>The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft.</p>\n<p>Like in the previous year, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/7161/jim-hughson/">Jim Hughson</a> and <a href="/search/?q=Darryl+Reaugh">Darryl Reaugh</a> liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary.</p>',

      "<p>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! </p>\n<p><em>Re-Volt</em> is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a \"reversed\" (backwards) or \"mirror\" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. </p>\n<p>There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. </p>\n<p>In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.</p>",

      "<p>An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base, there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcome countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.</p>\n<p>id Software's follow-up to <a href=\"/search/?q=DOOM\">Doom</a> and <a href=\"/search/?q=DOOM+II:+Hell+on+Earth\">Doom II</a>, <em>Quake</em> is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves, as well as the enemies, are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level-designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.</p>\n<p>In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.</p>\n<p>Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies, and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons, and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.</p>\n<p>The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws), and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel. Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers, and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.</p>\n<p><em>Quake</em> was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play, and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps specially designed for deathmatch.</p>",

In <em>Shadow Man</em> your mission is to prevent five serial killers from bringing the total Armageddon. In the world of the living, you're mortal and have conventional weapons. When you die, you are transported to the world of the dead and you become Shadow Man once again. Which means you're not really mortal. In the world of the dead you can't use normal weapons, your gun shoots ghosts which kill the zombies and the other ugly creatures which live there. You also have different voodoo powers and weapons. And you're carrying a large inventory around.</p>",

LeMonde is armed with one prototype nuclear missile warhead, modified to catalyze a chain reaction that can completely destroy the ozone layer and thus irradiate the Earth. The hunt for LeMonde will take the player from Indocine (intended to suggest Indochina, the mainland of South East Asia), to the South China Sea to combat Napoleon Hwong, then to the heart of North Korea to uncover the nuclear schemes of Kym Zung-Lee (intended to suggest Kim Jong Il), and finally to Siberia for a final battle. </p>\n<p>With the aid of fellow operatives, the player pilots the Super Apache, a fictional helicopter variant that is armed with Hellfire and Sidewinder missiles as well as Hydra cannons. Various other vehicles are also available during the course of the game, including tanks and jet fighters.</p>',

      '<p>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank." The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier. Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!</p>\n<p>Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see <a href="/search/?q=Battlezone">Battlezone </a> and <a href="/search/?q=Asteroids">Asteroids</a>). But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.</p>\n<p>You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels. You\'ll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you\'ll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you\'ll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</p>',

      '<p><em>Worms: Armageddon</em> is a standalone expansion to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1143/worms-2/">Worms 2</a>, introducing extensive improvements and additions over the original game, among which are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>16 new weapons and 6 new utilities, with some existing ones changed or rebalanced (3 were removed entirely)</li>\n<li>new singleplayer campaigns and challenges</li>\n<li>new gameplay schemes, some of which have to be unlocked through campaign missions (certain weapons are only available in some of these schemes)</li>\n<li>new menu interface, sounds, voice banks, and music</li>\n<li>new predefined maps</li>\n<li>expanded map editor, included voice bank editor (the latter is a separate application)</li>\n<li>teams can now have custom representative flags, victory anthems, and gravestones</li>\n<li>each team is assigned a special weapon of choice - Holy Hand Grenade, Flamethrower, Mad Cows, or Old Lady</li>\n<li>AI-controlled teams now have one of five difficulty settings</li>\n<li>jumping controls updated so worms can jump backwards and do backflips</li>\n<li>instead of selecting a worm at the start of each turn, this option is now regarded as a utility and usually has a limited number of uses</li>\n<li>new multiplayer options, including a more elaborate WormNET lobby</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like the previous <em>Worms</em> installments, the game is an artillery variant. The player give an artillery piece a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit the opponent, taking into account wind effects. The player and the opponent exchange these shots in a turn-based fashion. The game puts the player in command of a team of up to eight worms, which can move around the landscape (one at a time), using many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. In some situations, the worms can also jump, swing by rope, and descend with a parachute.</p>\n<p>As of 2002, updates have been handled by an authorized community member named Deadcode, who was joined in 2006 by CyberShadow. The two have removed many bugs and glitches, improved game stability and compatibility for Windows operating systems that have been released along the way, added new features (more resolutions, expanded options and settings, auto-recorded match replays, full PNG support for map importing...) and integrated WormKit, an extension framework for the game which allows for easier modding. These updates have been available from Team17\'s servers and are included by default in subsequent digital releases.</p>',

The graphics are isometric, whereas the original had graphics displayed in a top-down fashion.</p>\n<p>This title adds numerous features over the original such as the ability of building "light" zones, subways, hospitals, colleges, zoos, and arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can trade goods. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game, you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.</p>',

In the <em>Road to the World Cup</em> mode, you take a team from first qualification through to the main tournament, using the varying systems in different parts of the world. The game features 16 distinct outdoor stadia. The League play features 189 clubs and 11 leagues. Each team has specific crowd chants incorporated into the ambient sound.</p>\n<p>The action is faster than in previous versions, and AI has been expanded. Players have distinct facial feature and hair styles. Each match is introduced by Des Lynam and commentated on by John Motson and former Scotland international Andy Gray.</p>",

The player can choose from 15 different fighters at the start (and several unlockables later on). Many fighters from earlier games in the series make a comeback (like Scorpion, Sub Zero, Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage etc.) while other new fighters join in, like Shinook (who is the main evil character in this game), Fujin, Jarek, and Kai. Goro returns as a boss</p>\n<p>Gameplay is very typical for a <em>Mortal Kombat</em> game, but has several new features - for example characters can use weapons in a fight (not only as a special move) or avoid attacks in the 3D environment.</p>',

      '<p>The cosmos is controlled by two Prime Elements, known as "Core" and "Dark". Each is possessed by a tyrant who is in perpetual search of the third element, the Light, which would grant its owner tremendous power. Sonork Nezom, the carrier of Core Element, has organized a fighting tournament, with Core Element itself being the prize. He hopes that the carrier of the Light Element will be among the participants. He plans then to strike and gain possession of all the elements at once. But Lord Demon Demitron, the carrier of the Dark Element, has other plans...</p>\n<p>In this one-on-one fighting game, the player can take any of the eight playable participants through the tournament mode. Once the selected hero has defeated his opponents, he will have to face battles against Sonork and Demitron. A practice mode is also available. During the fights the player can use standard attacks common for all the characters - vertical and horizontal punches, kicks, running jumps, etc. Each character also possesses an arsenal of special techniques, which can be executed by pressing different buttons in rapid succession.</p>',

Whether this is a good or bad thing pretty much depends on how you liked <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/367/carmageddon/">the first</a>.</p>\n<p>In case you need to be told, this game sends the politically-correct-o-meter flying towards absolute zero, perhaps only beaten by <a href="/search/?q=Duke+Nukem+3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a>. The framework is a futuristic race inspired by Deathrace 2000 and The Cars That Ate Paris: The contestants, in sport cars, monster trucks, and other motorized abominations, are placed on a track, a real populated area. Getting to the finish line first is secondary, and in fact seldom happens; the real winner is the one to trash everyone else, running over pedestrians on the way for extra profit.</p>',

      '<p>The year is 1947. Dr. Jones Jr is on a retirement from adventuring, living the life of a scholar and an archaeologist. But soon he meets his old flame ...and new enemies. Soviets are tracking parts of a mysterious, powerful machine from ancient Babylon, hoping to use it as a weapon. They must be stopped from unleashing unspeakable danger from another world.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to lead Indy into adventures in lost temples, under mountains and through unexplored mines, for tales of missing artifacts, snake encounters and other things?</p>\n<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine</em> combined action and adventure in a way the older Indy games did not do. The gameplay is inspired by <a href="/search/?q=Tomb+Raider">Tomb Raider</a>, as Indy moves through 3D representations of 17 locations around the world. The game engine is modified from <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/153176/jedi-knight/">Jedi Knight</a>.</p>\n<p>Puzzles based around switches &amp; items; precise jumping must be negotiated on regular basis. You must use ladders, ropes and dinghies as well as moving on foot. You will also find yourself aboard a jeep and a mine cart. Replacements for your standard whip can be collected en route (from Soviet army arsenal), including grenades, sub-machine guns and bazookas. The valuable treasures you find can be used to buy extra ammo (between the levels). After each level you get your score (Indy Quotient) - you must reach all the treasure items cleverly hidden in secret places to get all the points.</p>',

While the Heretic was destroying D\'Sparil, the other two Serpent Riders have come to your dimension and slaughtered everyone. Or so they thought. Three humans have managed to escape with their lives and now seek vengeance against the Serpent Rider Korax who remains in their world.</p>\n<p>Like <em>Heretic</em>, <em>Hexen</em> is a fantasy game based on an enhanced <a href="/search/?q=3D+Engine:+DOOM">DOOM engine</a>. All of <em>Heretic</em>\'s innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage. Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor.</p>\n<p>The hub system steps away from the traditional "single levels stringed along into episodes" system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by <a href="/search/?q=Wolfenstein+3D:+The+Claw+of+Eisenfaust">Wolfenstein 3D</a>. In <em>Hexen</em>\'s hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single "hub" level through portals. There are also portals between some of the "spoke" levels. Many of the puzzles in <em>Hexen</em> require travel back and forth between different levels.</p>\n<p>Other innovations in <em>Hexen</em> include weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases. The game also includes scripted sequences created with a language called ACS, allowing for much more complex puzzles and dramatic scenes.</p>',

      "<p>Admiral Razorbeard and his gang of robot pirates have enslaved all the creatures in Rayman's world, including the peaceful Teensies and the Lums, which give life to the earth. Rayman has been captured by the pirates as well and is lamenting his troubles in his prison cell when he meets his good friend, Globox. Globox has smuggled in a silver Lum, given to him by the great fairy, Ly. With the power of the silver Lum, Rayman is able to once more shoot his fists. With his power restored, the pair escape the flying prison ship and embark on another adventure to save the entire world!</p>\n<p><em>Rayman 2: The Great Escape</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"/search/?q=008888310013\">Rayman</a>, a 2D side-scrolling platform game. Unlike the previous game, <em>Rayman 2</em> is entirely in free-roaming 3D environments, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3533/super-mario-64/\">Super Mario 64</a>. Rayman has many unique abilities that can help him get around the world. In addition to being able to shoot his fists, he can use his hair to hover like a helicopter, and even glide on air currents in certain places. He can climb certain walls and ceilings and can even use his fists to swing from special purple Lums which are shaped like rings. Rayman also has many unique items at his disposal, such as powder kegs which can be carried or fly like jets, strange warheads with legs that he can ride and steer like bucking mules, and gigantic plums that can be thrown into the water to create new paths.</p>\n<p>Rayman's goal is to find the four masks of the world, which allow the owner to reawaken Polokus, the spirit of the world. These masks are scattered far and wide, and are well hidden and guarded, so it is not an easy task. By gathering the yellow Lums, Rayman will gain access to new worlds, which will take him to the locations of new masks. Collecting yellow Lums also rewards him with new powers and life meter extensions.</p>\n<p>The Nintendo 64 and Windows platforms are the original versions of the game. The Nintendo DS version sticks closest to this version.</p>\n<p>The Dreamcast version adds a new area to the original version called Globox Village which contains exclusive mini-games. The mini-games are unlocked by collecting six hidden Globox crystals. Also, other changes include The Hall of Doors being changed into a new place called The Isle of Doors and more Robo-Pirates to contend with, including a new type not seen in the original version. The iOS and Nintendo 3DS versions are based on this version but don't include the Globox Village section. However, the 3DS version features a dynamic difficulty curve, with the game getting easier if too many lums are missed.</p>\n<p>The PlayStation version features a heavy alteration of the levels with some being merged and some being removed altogether, although there are also some new areas as well. This includes a new unlockable bonus area that was from the originally planned 2D version of the game that was scrapped. The amount of collectible Lums was reduced from 1,000 to 800. In this version characters are also voiced with actual real languages instead of the whisper speak of the other versions. </p>\n<p>The PlayStation 2 version adds minigames, exclusive items like the Lumz Radar, and offers more abilities for Rayman to purchase and use.\nAlong with some expanded level revisions with lums being placed in different locations, there are three new bosses to contend with. The Hall of Doors has become hub locations, The Minisaurus Plain, Globox's House, and The Rainbow Creek. Bonus challenges can also be played by freeing caged Familiar Spirits. These prisoners are exclusive to this version of the game. The game also gives the option to use either the real language voice-overs or the older version's style and lets players save mid-level.</p>",

For many generations, the mantle of Turok has been bestowed upon those who saw the protection of the barrier as their sacred duty. But an evil lord named Campaigner is seeking for an artifact that is capable of destroying the barrier, striving to dominate the entire universe. This artifact, known as the Chronoscepter, was broken into pieces which were then hidden away. Tal'Set, a Native American and the last Turok, must find the scattered pieces of the Chronoscepter, and stop the Campaigner from obtaining them.</p>\n<p><em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em> is a first-person shooter with platforming and light puzzle-solving elements. Much of the game is set in outdoor environments, and requires the player to explore them by finding various paths, jumping, swimming, and climbing. The game's most notable enemies are dinosaurs of various sizes, though the levels also include human and demonic enemies, as well as wildlife. The player gradually gains access to thirteen weapons (plus the Chronoscepter, assembling which is the game's main objective); these include a knife, a bow, as well as high-tech firearms such as a rocket launcher and an atomic fusion cannon.</p>",

      '<p><em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> is the sequel to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/2203/turok-dinosaur-hunter/">Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</a>.\nHaving defeated the Campaigner, Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. Unfortunately the blast awakens an even deadlier force - The Primagen - who lays in wait for his freedom from a wrecked space craft, buried at the core of the Lost Land. Once again a Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world.</p>\n<p>The game features an armory twice as large as its predecessor, and many weapons will even have a later update that makes them even more devastating. New weapons include the lethal discus Razor Wind, a proximity mine layer, and the Cerebral Bore, a flying grenade that homes in on an enemy\'s head, drills through their skull, and then explodes. Enemies have damage models now, allowing limbs to be torn off or bloody holes to be blasted through torsos. Turok won\'t be facing any human opponents this time, but will find himself under attack by plenty of dinosaur/human hybrids, brutish giants, and man-sized insectoids.</p>\n<p>The goal of each level is to reach the end and defend one of the five totems that keeps the Primagen captive in its ship as well as finding keys to unlock the portals that lead to later levels. In each level Turok can also find a special spiritual power, such as immunity to lava or a long jump. After finding a power, he will need to return to an earlier level to use that power to find one of the five keys that opens the portal to the Primagen itself. While searching for spiritual powers Turok will occasionally find portals that transport him to a strange place full of deadly creatures who appear to be unaffiliated with the Primagen, but discovering their true purpose <a href="/search/?q=Turok+3:+Shadow+of+Oblivion">is the job for another Turok</a>.</p>\n<p>A multiplayer game is included as well, with options for between 2 and 4 players and game-types like deathmatch and capture-the-flag. This multiplayer mode would later be expanded into a full game with <a href="/search/?q=Turok:+Rage+Wars">Turok: Rage Wars</a>.</p>',

This time, it is also possible to use any picture to serve as a player photo.</p>\n<p>New to this installment (beside Jordan) is a one-on-one street basketball mode, and a mode that allows management of a team for several seasons, including trading players.</p>',

He gets a lot of money and an agent suit for that. The game generally resolves around a James Bondish spy theme, but the story is not referenced later in the game.</p>\n<p>Gex has to enter levels through TVs to collect three types of remote controls in order to unlock more of the Media Dimension, boss levels and secret TVs. Gex can tailwhip or karate-kick his enemies, climb certain walls and ceilings, eat bugs for power-ups, and spout one-liner wisecrack jokes. The gameplay is non-linear, the player can choose from multiple routes and goals on each level, and are replayable anytime after accomplished.</p>",

      '<p>The sequel to <a href="/search/?q=Tony+Hawk\'s+Pro+Skater">Tony Hawk\'s Pro Skater</a> adds many new tricks, while retaining those from the original, and a complete roster of the greatest skaters worldwide. Among the new tricks is the "manual", which allows the player character to balance on two wheels. There are also more options for scoring high-trick combos. Trick combinations can also be edited and customized. It is possible to visit some of the most popular skate parks in the world, or create own areas and share them with other players. Players can also create their own skaters, with a choice of clothing and official skateboards.</p>',

There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks.</p>',

Most of the mini games are parodies of classic arcade games. The player chooses a South Park character (Kyle, Kenny, Stan, or Cartman) and answers the questions based on episodes from the cartoon series. If the player gets it right, they then spin a wheel, and get either cash, lose it all, or play a mini game (either by themselves, against the AI, or against other players if playing in multiplayer mode). The person who has the highest score (or the most correct answers) after a chosen amount of rounds wins.</p>',

The only man that can stop him is the interstellar bounty hunter Dash Rendar. The game is based on the novel of the same name, with locations including ice planet Hoth, Mos Eisley and the sewers of Imperial City, all in full 3D.</p>\n<p>Levels each have very different objectives, ranging from piloting snowspeeders on Hoth and racing speeder bikes on Tatooine to shooting stormtroopers and droids on foot throughout the galaxy. Dash primarily uses a blaster with unlimited ammo, but can also find more powerful weapons with limited ammunition. Each level has optional \"challenge points\" that are hidden throughout the level, and finding all of them will unlock a cheat dependent on which difficulty setting the save file is on.</p>",

      "<p>A wizard is mixing up a batch of magic potions, when an explosion sends the gloves off his hands flying into the air. One lands safetly outside the castle, but the other lands in an evil potion mixture. It's this evil glove that decides to take over the castle. Meanwhile, 7 crystals, which used to sit on top of the castle and gave the surrounding lands its life force, also fly off in all directions. Thankfully, though, the good Glove changes the crystals into rubber balls, so that they would land safely. </p>\n<p>You must control the good glove (name Glover) and find the 7 crystals, putting them back into the castle to restore the life back into the land. But be careful, the bad glove is out to stop you and take the kingdom, and the wizards power, for his own.</p>",

Ice blocks fall to freeze the water. Bombs drop, leaving holes in walls, and fireballs vaporize the water. The aim is to get as high a score as possible. There is a practice mode available, and the game can be played in multiplayer against a friend.</p>",

      "<p>In a world covered almost entirely in water, there exist small islands that hide huge treasures. And where there's treasure, you can find treasure hunters called Diggers, who live for the thrill of the hunt...</p>\n<p>Barrel Casket was once one of the greatest Diggers, but he has now retired. He now cares for his young granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on a dig. He had also discovered a strange baby boy in some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby boy Rock Voulnut, and Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan.</p>\n<p>While out exploring one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel's airship, the Flutter, crash lands on an island named Kattelox. As they explore Kattelox in hopes of fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel decide to look for the treasure, but at the same time, they're going to get a little competition from a pirate family named the Bonnes...</p>\n<p><em>Mega Man Legends</em> is the first of the <em>Mega Man</em> series to take place in fully explorable 3D, and is paced more like an RPG than the previous stage-to-stage action games. Rock can explore the town and follow the story to find entrances to the underground ruins, where in he will find traps, feral Reaverbots, and large boss robots. Destroying enemies will reward Rock with health, sub-weapon energy, and the power cores of the robots, which people in his world use as currency. By searching through the town and ruins Rock will find items of dubious use and value, and they can be brought back to Roll to be assembled into useful items and upgradable sub-weapons, although not for free. Rock can run while shooting, go into first person mode for aimed shots, and also lock onto an enemy and circle around them to avoid their attacks.</p>",

      '<p>A comet is heading toward South Park, causing many of the enemies from early seasons of the shows (including cows, aliens, and clones) to rise up and attack.  The player takes control of Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Stan to fight through the town in a first-person perspective.  Features new dialogue from the original voice actors on the show.</p>\n<p>Single player takes the form of a "Story" mode divided into five episodes and fifteen linear levels.  The player will face weak minions (which change based on the episode), plus occasional sub-bosses which will try to escape into town. The final level is devoted to a unique boss fight.  Players use quirky weapons ranging from infinite yellow snowballs to cow launchers and toxic Terrance and Phillip dolls.  Every weapon has a secondary fire, and players switch between the four main characters when they switch weapons - each of the four kids shares a single life bar because of this.  The kids will comment on game actions as they occur, with heavier profanity censored with bleeps.  The kids will get angrier (and fouler) as their health depletes, until they finally give up on saving the town and go home.</p>\n<p>A multiplayer mode lets players take characters and weapons they unlock in Story mode into small deathmatch arenas. The PlayStation version supports 2 players, the N64 does 4, and the PC version allows players to go online to search for opponents through GameSpy.  Players can set standard victory options like knockouts or time limits.  Voice samples for multiplayer are also included, so the characters will make comments and taunts when hit.</p>\n<p>Graphics are rendered in 3D, in a style approximating that of the show.  Draw distance is limited by a heavy fog, with varying severity based on the platform.  None of the environments are interactive, and only enemies respond to weapon hits.  The N64 version supports the Expansion Pak.</p>',

      '<p>The name is Bond. James Bond. The famous hero of Ian Fleming\'s novels returns in this first-person shooter, which is based on the movie of the same name. Agent 007 and his friend Alec Trevalyan (a.k.a. Agent 006) were sent to the Soviet Union on a secret mission. But everything goes wrong, James Bond barely escapes, and his friend is presumed dead.</p>\n<p>Ten years later, a mysterious organization named "Janus" appeared. Commanding a new satellite called "GoldenEye", the organization attempts to steal money electronically from banks, deleting all evidence of transfer. It\'s up to our Agent 007 to venture to the Soviet Union once again and to put an end to Janus\' ambitions.</p>\n<p>In this 3D action game, the player controls James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of weapons (from knuckles to grenade launcher) to eliminate his foes. However, many parts require the player to be careful, to stay unnoticed, or to snipe guards from distance, since they will react to his presence and alarm their comrades. The game is divided into missions, and in most of them Bond will have to perform other tasks besides killing his enemies: disarm bombs, take pictures of important evidence, or avoid killing scientists. The game features a multiplayer mode with a variety of options and three difficulty levels. Higher difficulty means, besides having to deal with tougher enemies, additional objectives needed to be fulfilled in order to successfully complete the level.</p>',

      "<p>Mario is invited to Peach's castle, but when he arrives Peach is nowhere to be seen. He soon learns from Toad that Bowser has once again kidnapped her. The Koopa King has also put a spell on her castle, imprisoning her subjects. So it is up to Mario to break the spell and rescue Peach.</p>\n<p><em>Super Mario 64</em> is the first Mario game done entirely with 3D graphics. The core gameplay is similar to previous platform installments, focusing on jumping, avoiding obstacles, and defeating enemies. Levels can be explored without time limits. Stars must be collected in order to unlock new areas, eventually gaining access to various parts of Bowser's castle. Defeating Bowser on each floor procures keys necessary to unlock big doors and enter other floors, which contain more areas. </p>\n<p>Mario has more moves at his disposal in this installment. Besides running and jumping, he can now walk, crouch, crawl, climb, and punch enemies. Double and triple jumps, long jumps, wall jumps, and backflips can be executed as well. Swimming underwater now depletes Mario's oxygen level. Items must be picked up and carried in some instances in order to solve puzzles.</p>\n<p>Power-ups include the Wing Cap, which allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, which protects him from damage (including environmental hazards such as poisonous gas); and the Vanish Cap, which makes Mario ethereal, allowing him to walk through certain obstacles (such as wire mesh). Mario can also enter cannons and be shot from them; combining this with the flying ability grants access to high areas.</p>",

      "<p><em>Mario Kart 64</em> races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad's Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser's Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong's Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road. </p>\n<p>The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess's smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong's. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups.</p>",

The bigger your frags are at the end of each level determines which direction you take on the universe tree, which is split into three levels: easy, medium, and hard. All three link back to the end for the final level.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer modes are also included, allowing four people to battle in Arwings, or if you complete every objective in the single player missions, they can battle on-foot, where the four main characters run around with laser cannons.</p>',

      '<p><em>Mario Party</em> is a party game for 1 to 4 players. The festivities are based on a board game format, right down to the fact that players must roll a die to determine how many spaces to move. Players land on different squares, each space holding one of more than fifty different mini-games. These quick competitions determine who will earn coins and stars, and who will go home empty handed. </p>\n<p>The mini-games are spread over eight different game boards, all of which are not immediately available. Some of the games pit every man or princess against the others, some are two-on-two, and others are even three against one. One challenge is loosely based on "Simon Says", another involves a two-on-two bobsled race, and one game makes one player attempt to cross a rope while the other three do their best to shake the player off. There are skill games, racing games, puzzle games, and other types.</p>\n<p>A good portion of the actual game boards are animated, with hidden dangers and special challenges scattered everywhere. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Yoshi, and Wario are all invited to the party, and each character has his or her own game board.</p>',

      "<p>Since Mario rescued Princess Peach in Super Mario 64, he's been thoroughly enjoying his free time. Bowser hasn't been causing too much trouble, so Mario and his friends have decided to take a trip to the golf course. Waialae Country Club wouldn't allow a couple of underdressed plumbers to become members, so they've come up with their own golf game for Nintendo 64. </p>\n<p><em>Mario Golf 64</em> features an all-star line up of 10 golfers from Nintendo's cast of video game celebrities, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Each golfer has an individual set of strengths and weaknesses. A highlight of Mario Golf 64 is a special \"Time Attack Mode,\" where players must compete to finish a round of golf as quickly as possible. </p>\n<p>Mario Golf 64 features an impressive line-up of six courses, which means you'll have to master a total of 108 holes. An optional \"Club Handicap Mode\" ensures that you stay close to the competition, so Luigi won't get too frustrated if he falls behind. Even though the golfers are cartoons, the physics are as realistic as possible. The CPU calculates the exact ball movement based on wind direction, the strength of the strike, and any spin you may choose to place on the ball.</p>",

      '<p>Loosely based on the Super Famicom/SNES game <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6602/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi\'s Island</a>, <em>Yoshi\'s Story</em> follows the adventures of six Yoshis as they search through sunny woods, dark caves, soaring mountains, steaming jungles, vast oceans, and gloomy castles for the Super Happy Tree, which has been stolen by the dreaded Baby Bowser. Yoshi can walk, run, swim, leap, flutter, and fire his payload of eggs. The action takes place in storybook "pages" made up of bookmaking materials and other familiar textures, including cut-paper forests, denim clouds, inflatable plastic islands, and stacks of colored spools.</p>\n<p>The game pioneers use of the Rumble Pak as a key element of the gameplay experience, the player being able to feel invisible but treacherous currents when Yoshi swims through oceanic depths. The Rumble Pak can also help the player locate hidden fruit or other objects by rumbling when Yoshi smells something. With a light touch of the Control Stick it becomes possible to float on a leaf, ride a friendly dragon, and tiptoe past a swarm of angry bees.</p>',

      "<p><em>Wave Race 64</em> is a jet-ski racing game. The goal is to beat the other participants in the race by successfully navigating the jet-ski through courses marked by colored buoys. Red and yellow buoys must be passed on right and left side, respectively, in order to gain speed and ensure advantage in the race. Failure to pass the buoys, on the other hand, leads to decrease in speed and eventually disqualification.</p>\n<p>Game modes include Warm Up (basically a training session in a course known as Dolphin Park); Time Trials, in which players race against time; Championship, in which players compete in a tournament, choosing one of the four available difficulty levels; and Stunt Mode, where performing various stunts awards players with point. A two-player split-screen versus mode is available as well. Players can customize their racers, modifying their parameters, which include grip, handling, acceleration, top speed and collision stability.</p>",

There are 8 fully-interactive landscapes, with one for each character, with noticeable links to their games. Controls are analogue-based, with different moves executed depending on the direction and how firmly the stick is pressed. Items like baseball bats, Bob-ombs, and healing items drop into the arenas at random, aiding any nearby characters than can make use of them. The game uses a fixed viewpoint which scrolls, although characters are rendered in 3D.</p>\n<p>The one-player mode has 14 stages to work through. Up to 4 human players can do battle at once, with team play as well as all-against-all action. Hidden characters are thrown in for good measure, as are bonus rounds, and a battle to the end with a giant hand (you read right).</p>\n<p>Playable characters include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Captain Falcon* <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/1601/f-zero-series/">(F-Zero series)</a><em> Donkey Kong <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/502/donkey-kong-games/">(Donkey Kong games)</a></em> Fox <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/589/star-fox-series/">(Star Fox series)</a><em> Kirby <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/493/kirby-games/">(Kirby games)</a></em> Jigglypuff* <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/475/pokemon-universe/">(Pokémon universe)</a><em> Link <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/596/legend-of-zelda-series/">(Legend of Zelda series)</a></em> Luigi* <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/484/mario-games/">(Mario games)</a><em> Mario <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/484/mario-games/">(Mario games)</a></em> Ness* <a href="/search/?q=Mother/EarthBound+series">(Mother/EarthBound series)</a><em> Pikachu <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/475/pokemon-universe/">(Pokémon universe)</a></em> Samus <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/606/metroid-series/">(Metroid series)</a>* Yoshi <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/484/mario-games/">(Mario games)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>* denotes any characters that need to be unlocked under special conditions first.</p>',

Game types include ring shot (where you must shoot the ball through golden hoops that are suspended above the play area, gaining bonus points as you play), bomb tennis (simply put Tennis with Bombs) and Piranha Challenge (much like the tennis machines which chuck balls at you, but in this case they are replaced with Piranha plants). Of course, there is your normal tournament mode, with up to 4 players in on the action, and some crazy arenas, especially Bowser's Castle, which is suspended above a lava pit!</p>",

      "<p>A young boy named Link was raised in the village of the elf-like Kokiri people. One day a fairy named Navi introduces him to the village's guardian, the Great Deku Tree. It appears that a mysterious man has cursed the tree, and Link is sent to the Hyrule Castle to find out more. Princess Zelda tells Link that Ganondorf, the leader of the Gerudo tribe, seeks to obtain the Triforce, a holy relic that grants immense power to the one who possesses it. Link must do everything in his power to obtain the Triforce before Ganondorf does, and save Hyrule.</p>\n<p><em>Ocarina of Time</em> is the first 3D installment of the Legend of Zelda series. Like most of its predecessors, it is an action game with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements. Gameplay is similar to the previous games, allowing Link to explore the world and complete dungeons to obtain key items and advance the plot. Sword combat as well as many familiar items such as boomerang, bombs, the series' currency (rupees) of various values, heart containers, and their collectible fragments permanently increasing Link's health, etc., return in this installment. Link can now lock on enemies for melee and ranged combat, actively use a shield to deflect projectiles, as well as use various magic items. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games. Link can climb certain surfaces, dive underwater, as well as automatically jump.</p>\n<p>The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on, an adult Link becomes a playable character as well. Each of them has certain unique abilities: for example, only adult Link can use a bow and arrows, but only the child Link can crawl through narrow spaces. During the course of the game, the player obtains the Ocarina of Time. Learning and playing melodies on that ocarina is needed to advance the plot, complete certain side quests, or travel in time, switching between the two versions of Link. It is also possible to befriend and ride a horse named Epona to facilitate travel between areas.</p>",

      "<p>After having fulfilled Princess Zelda's request and saved the land of Hyrule from grave danger, Link departs on his horse Epona. In the Lost Woods he is ambushed by Skull Kid, an imp who dons a mysterious mask, accompanied by the fairies Tael and Tatl. Skull Kid turns Link into a small plant-like creature known as Deku Scrub and takes away his horse and his magical ocarina. Shortly afterward Tatl joins Link and agrees to help him revert to his native form. A meeting with a wandering mask salesman reveals that the Skull Kid is wearing Majora's Mask, an ancient item used in hexing rituals, which calls forth a menacing moon hovering over the land of Termina. Link has exactly three days to find a way to prevent this from happening.</p>\n<p><em>Majora's Mask</em> is a direct sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3549/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/\">Ocarina of Time</a>. It utilizes the same engine and visual style, and virtually identical interface. The game retains the traditional elements of Zelda games (dungeon exploration, sword fighting, bows, bombs, heart containers, etc.) as well as those introduced in its immediate predecessor, such as active blocking with a shield, various throwing items, and the usage of melodies played on the ocarina to solve puzzles. Compared to the previous Zelda games, this installment is more oriented towards interaction with NPCs and has a larger variety of items, optional quests, and mini-games.</p>\n<p>Also unique to this entry is its time system. The game has an internal clock, with one hour roughly corresponding to one real-life minute. If the player hasn't completed all the objectives within three in-game days, the moon falls on Termina, annihilating everyone and ending the game. However, the player can return to the first day at any time by playing a song on the ocarina, saving all quest-related progress and inventory but losing other items such as ammunition or money (unless stored in a bank). It is also possible to learn melodies that slow the time passage significantly or advance the clock instantly to the next day. Some events happen only at specific times, and many characters follow their own schedules throughout the three days. Owl statues scattered across the land provide quick-save points and serve as teleporters between areas when discovered.</p>\n<p>Collection and usage of masks play an important role in the game. Most of the twenty-four masks that can be found in the game are optional, and usually serve to solve side quests or enhance Link's abilities, allowing him, for example, to run faster or to become invisible. Transformation masks can be used to turn Link into a Deku Scrub, a Goron, or a Zora. Each of these forms has access to unique abilities, many of which are essential to the completion of the game. Among other skills, Deku Link can shoot bubbles from his mouth and float between flowers; Goron Link can operate heavy switches and walk through lava without taking damage, and weigh down heavy switches; Zora Link can swim fast and generate force fields.</p>",

      "<p><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> is a skateboarding simulation in which you control a famous skate star around 3D environments. Each game area contains a plethora of objects like ramps, rails, and half-pipes which can be used to perform tricks. Each trick you perform earns you more points for your score.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into two types of levels. In the first, you skate around locations like a mall, a city street, or a warehouse. In each of these areas, there are 5 goals to complete. Some goals involve obtaining a high score, others smashing objects and some collecting objects. For every goal you complete, you earn a videotape. By collecting enough videotapes, you unlock levels and skateboards for you to use. There are 6 levels like this. The second type of level is competition. You get to make 3 timed runs through a skate park and attempt to get the highest score possible. If you do well enough, you will beat the scores of the computer-controlled skaters and win a medal. There are 3 levels like this.</p>\n<p>There are nine real-life pro skaters you can choose to play as, including Tony Hawk himself. Each skater has their own signature moves that earn you big points if pulled off successfully.</p>",

      '<p>It\'s an island takeover when the evil space wizard, Wizpig, discovers Tiger Island! After the islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him reclaim the racetracks and save the island before his parents return. Along for the ride are the Kremling spy Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3583/banjo-kazooie/">Banjo-Kazooie</a>), pre-sweary <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Twelve+Tales:+Conker+64">Conker</a>, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse.</p>\n<p><em>Diddy Kong Racing</em> is a racing game with similarities to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3535/mario-kart-64/">Mario Kart 64</a>, in that you race with a variety of cheery racers while using weapons. However, the similarities end there. DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, <strong>many</strong> hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the "Silver Coin Challenge". In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).</p>\n<p>The game also features a strategic method of using weapons. Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times). This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version of it later.</p>\n<p>Up to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be unlocked in the single player game. There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).</p>',

      "<p><em>Bomberman 64</em> is a 3D action platformer. In the game's one-player Adventure mode, marauders have set their sights on Bomberman's peaceful planet. You'll explore labyrinthine levels by dropping bombs, solving puzzles and finding hidden items. The action takes place across five brightly colored worlds: a smoldering volcano, ruined castle, icy mountain range, orbiting space station and storybook village. Find all 100 Gold Cards in the first five worlds and you can access a sixth world. To maximize your score, you'll need to finish each of the 20 levels as quickly as possible. Deadlines are tighter on the Hard difficulty setting. </p>\n<p>The game's multiplayer mode comes in two variations: in Single Battle mode, players dash about arenas, trying to blow each other to pieces. Team Battle mode is a highly explosive version of capture-the-flag. Your goal here is to destroy the enemy team's gems while protecting your own. You can choose the number and duration of battles. You can also choose from three levels of artificial intelligence for CPU-controlled bombers. </p>\n<p>When the Ghost option is selected, your little guy will return as a wispy double of his old self after he's gone boom. Ghosts can control a normal Bomberman, but they cannot deploy bombs. Other features include the possibility to toss or kick your bombs diagonally, the ability to pump up bombs, knock foes unconscious and then grab and toss them.</p>",

      "<p>As many as four (Expansion Pak required) can band together in an epic quest through seven magical worlds -- three of which are brand-new to the home version -- to defeat the vile Skorne. </p>\n<p>The nonlinear action begins in a hub, which leads to the worlds, each with two to five levels. You can complete a level in one world, then move to another world, returning later to finish a new level in the first world. </p>\n<p>Developer Atari Games has delivered four new characters in addition to the four in the arcade version. Each character will have unique special attacks. Controller Pak support will allow players to team their evolving characters. </p>\n<p>Enemies, bosses, power-ups, music and sound effects are all getting radical makeovers. Atari is busily remapping carryover levels and cooking up devious new puzzles and hiding places for items, so don't even think of cribbing from the coin-op version. </p>\n<p>Graphical updates include real-time lighting, which is nowhere to be found in the arcade version. The N64 Expansion Pak pushes plenty of polygon-based enemies onto the screen. </p>\n<p>The essential action -- team up with others, find keys, magic, runes and other items, and beat the stuffing out of anyone in your way -- remains unchanged from the arcade hit. Atari has delivered a far meatier storyline, though, spiffed up by cinema cut-scenes at the successful conclusion of a world.</p>",

However, the teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and it is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990's, but still a good game for someone who doesn't mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style football.</p>",

      '<p>Conker the Squirrel has had a really bad day. Too much partying, too much booze - and the result is predictable: a terrible hangover. What is less predictable, however, is the fact that Conker has no idea where he is. All he wants is to go home to his girlfriend Berri, but it seems that an unknown force has thrown him into another world. The ruler of said world, the dumb, but vicious Panther King, is having a serious problem: he has been just drinking milk when he discovered that the table in his throne room is missing one of its legs. Unable to solve the problem by himself, the enraged monarch sends for the mad weasel scientist, Professor Von Kriplespac, who suggests a red squirrel as a replacement for the table\'s lost leg. The Panther King sends his minions after Conker, who has to explore the bizarre world, deal with its eccentric characters, stay alive, and find a way to return home.</p>\n<p><em>Conker\'s Bad Fur Day</em> is a grotesque counterpart to Rare\'s own cheerful, child-oriented 3D action platformers (such as for example <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3583/banjo-kazooie/">Banjo-Kazooie</a>). Intense swearing, violence, and instances of "toilet humor" co-exist with cute animals and a brightly colorful fantasy world. The game also contains segments that parody famous movies, such as <a href="/search/?q=matrix"> The Matrix</a>, <a href="/search/?q=terminator"> Terminator</a>, and others.</p>\n<p>The core of the gameplay is 3D platform action. Conker can jump, climb, swim, and attack enemies with various weapons (the default one being a frying pan). Conker can also collect money, which is sometimes needed to advance to a new area. The game world is reasonably open, containing an overworld from which the player can access large levels that take a while to explore. Talking to characters and performing tasks offered by them is one of the main devices used to advance the plot and unlock a different area.</p>\n<p>A multiplayer mode is also included, allowing 4 players to battle it out in many different styles of multiplayer gameplay, including a deathmatch, a race, a "capture the flag"-like mini-game, etc.</p>',

      "<p>Get out of the way! A nuclear missile carrier is out of control on a one way-set path, and unless that path is cleared, it will explode as soon as it makes contact with anything, destroying the world. It is up to you to clear the path so that nothing gets in the way of the Carrier.</p>\n<p><em>Blast Corps</em> is a mix of an action and a puzzle game where destruction is key. At the start of each level the player is given a certain vehicle (ranging from robotic suits to trucks or bulldozers), and are told to clear the path for the Carrier. Players need to use their heavy-duty equipment to destroy any buildings, structures, or monuments that stand in the path of the Carrier. The difficulty increases as progress is made, though. Smaller vehicles don't affect certain buildings, and sometimes it's not even a building that's in the way. The player must use the resources around them to clear the path. Players may need a train flatbed to fill a gap, or a crane to move boxes out of the way. The Carrier is always moving, so once the player is done destroying one obstruction, they must get to the next one quickly. While players pursue their mission they must also find six scientists scattered throughout the globe to form a think-tank to solve the problem. The Carrier has to leave Earth, and it's your job to ensure that it will!</p>\n<p><em>Blast Corps</em> features secrets to find. Besides clearing each path for the Carrier, players can go back to a level once it has been completed to take their time and explore. To fully complete a level, players must also find RDUs (Radiation Dispersal Units), which light up on the ground when the player is in close proximity to them, as well as destroy all of the buildings, rescue all of the homeless civilians, which is done by the T-chopper that accompanies the player on every mission. There are also dozens of secret time trial levels that can be found by activating special satellite dishes hidden throughout the levels. If the player manages to get all of the secrets in a level they receive a second medal, and once all of the gold medals are found the developers have a tiny message for them...</p>",

      "<p>WCW/NWO Revenge puts the power of the biggest, baddest and meanest wrestlers around the world in the hands of the player. There are more than 60 real and fictional wrestlers - including then-superstars Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash, Raven and Goldberg - to choose from to square off in the ring in any of several modes of play. </p>\n<p>Each wrestler has an extensive list of moves they are able to perform, although certain physical attributes can affect the availability of certain actions - such as a heavyweight not being able to perform a moonsault from the top ropes, or a cruiserweight not being able to power bomb a larger opponent. The engine is based upon a B-button strike and A-button grapple system. Holding the respective button results in a 'heavy' strike or grapple. Finishing off an opponent generally involves performing your wrestler's special move on them, which can be executed with the flick of the control stick once the wrestler has filled his Spirit Meter, and will be followed with a TV-style instant replay. Depending on the match settings set beforehand, a player can find hidden weapons from the crowd, be assisted or double-teamed by a run-in interference or make his opponent tap out with a submission hold.</p>\n<p>There are several match types and game modes, all of which can take place in a number of arenas designed after the current WCW pay-per-view events of the time. New to the series is a 40-man battle royal, allowing for 4 players or computer-controlled wrestlers to square off in the ring at a time until one is pinned or submitted; at which point they are replaced by a new entrant, continuing on and on until up to 40 wrestlers have entered. The main focus of single-player wrestling revolved around the championship mode, in which a player chooses a wrestler and a championship belt to compete for - beginning with the TV Title on up to the WCW World Championship. After defeating a successive series of opponents, the player then goes toe-to-toe with the current holder of the belt for possession of the championship; upon victory a new wrestler and new championship is unlocked. 1-4 player exhibition matches can be set to play out with an assortment of various settings and rules - such as 2 vs. 1 handicaps, no-disqualifications and tag team battles.</p>\n<p>The game automatically tracks and saves to the battery the stats and arcade-style scores accrued across the various game modes. Also available to the player is a costume editing feature, allowing for quick color changes to full-on wardrobe conversions for each wrestler.</p>\n<p>Revenge was a refinement of the engine seminal wrestling house AKI developed for WCW/NWO World Tour. It would be their final WCW game, as the developer moved on and converted their engine to the WWF license with their next release.</p>",

All the wrestlers come with their real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into slide shows) and entrance performances. Another addition is the "Road to Wrestlemania" mode, an enhanced tournament where players can challenge for any number of belts and be challenged by other wrestlers in a twelve-month journey that finally leads to Wrestlemania 2000 itself.</p>',

      "<p>Duke Nukem 3D makes its way to the N64 for the first time, with plenty of new additions:</p>\n<p>Weapons: New weapons include two sub-machine guns (one in each hand), the Expander (the bad guys just go pop!) a plasma cannon (which is chargeable) and a grenade launcher. Sadly, there are a few missing from the original PC version, including the Ripper Chaingun, the Devastator, and the Freeze-Ray.</p>\n<p>Presentation: The biggest changes come here, as there are new areas to explore, some improved environments, and the same wise cracks that have made Duke famous. There are also some jokes hidden away based on classic movies (Clockwork Orange, 12 Monkeys, Mars Attacks and Apocalypse Now).</p>\n<p>However, there have been plenty of restrictions in this version of Duke 3D. Nintendo have replaced some areas (the porn mag shop has turned into a gun store, the bar is now a burger joint, and the nude women aren't nude anymore), and there is an option available to turn the blood off.</p>\n<p>A 4 player mode has also been included, where you can take on your mates as well as Duke Bots, and a 2 player co-op mode, so two players can tackle the single player missions.</p>",

      "<p>When the Primagen's Lightship was destroyed in <a href=\"/search/?q=Turok+2:+Seeds+of+Evil\">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</a> the resulting explosion created a shockwave throughout the universe. This effect nearly ended the life of Oblivion, a 'thing' that drifts through space, consuming anything that ends up in its way. Also during this explosion, a new world was created. In this world lies the Turok family tree, and Oblivion knows that the only way the pain the lies within can be stopped is to destroy the Turok line. </p>\n<p>The third title in the <em>Turok</em> series allows you to choose who will become the successor of the Turok lineage, either Danielle Fireseed or her brother Joseph. Each has unique paths through the same levels, as Joseph's small size allows him to fit into air ducts to take the low road, while Danielle's magnetic grappling hook allows her to take the high road. Each also has unique upgrades to basic weapons. While Danielle's shotgun upgrade coats the shrapnel in napalm to immolate anything they touch, Joseph's instead charges them with electricity, causing them to ricochet off of walls and floors. The story is told through in-game cutscenes with highly detailed models. There are no keys to collect this time around, as each level leads linearly into the next.</p>\n<p><em>Turok 2</em>'s multiplayer mode returns, and includes the ability to add computer controlled bots. Each playable character in multiplayer mode has a unique set of weapons they can use.</p>",

Before a match you also get to choose which weapons to use, and you can unlock heaps of more weapons and character skins as you complete the objectives.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer is the main aim of this game, and there are plenty of 4 player game modes to choose from (frag and tag, capture the flag, Bloodlust, etc.) as well as a 2 player co-op Trial mode (much like the single player missions) time trials and frag fests.</p>',

As Rocket you have to go through the worlds collecting (suddenly a dirty word) tokens and tickets and fixing machines to get the park up and running again. The vehicles are everything from a customizable roller-coaster to a paintball tank that allows you to paint the town red, or any other color you choose. In standard platformer fashion, tickets are hidden in out-of reach places or held by characters who give them to you, after you beat them at their own game. The realtime physics engine makes it even more interesting with objects actually tumbling and falling like they would in real life.</p>",

      "<p>Twins Juno and Vela, and their dog Lupus, are Jet Force Gemini, intergalactic police. Their mission? Stop the evil space bug, Mizar, from his goal of galactic conquest with his seemingly-infinite army of Drones. They'll have to stop along multiple planets along the way, and assisting King Jeff and rescuing his subjects, the Tribals.</p>\n<p><em>Jet Force Gemini</em> is a third-person shooter which revels in making gigantic creepy bugs explode into dribbly mucousy bits. The Jet Force team are given progressively more powerful weapons, from the Machine Gun, which rips through both enemies and ammo, the Plasma Shotgun, which you can charge up for some explosive fireworks, and the Tri-Rocket Launcher, which fires three rockets with every shot, sending explosive doom in the direction of your target. There's also the Fish Food, which, as the name implies, is used to feed fish.</p>\n<p>Each member of the team has their own special abilities - Juno can walk through lava without any trouble, Vela can swim underwater, and Lupus can hover for short distances and travel through tight spaces. These abilities are required to fully access areas that they previously couldn't reach. The team also get the help of Floyd the Droid, a hovering robot that can be controlled by player two as a floating gun with infinite ammo when he joins your team.</p>\n<p>The game also includes three different multiplayer modes: Battle - featuring most options of an average First Person Shooter but with a third-person perspective, Target Shoot - a shooting gallery with a first-person view, and Racing, which includes some kart-like racing as well as old-school top down racing games.</p>",

      '<p><em>007: The World is Not Enough</em> is a James Bond game based on the 1999 movie of the same name. Both game and film follow Bond\'s investigation of attacks on a British oil tycoon\'s new pipeline, while the game introduces new areas and a backstory not seen in the film. James Bond is a MI5 agent that employs gadgets and gunplay, with each mission requiring the player to complete specific objectives outlined in a pre-mission briefing.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/45707/007-the-world-is-not-enough/">PlayStation title</a> of the same name, this version is structured more like a successor to <a href="/search/?q=Rare,+Ltd.">Rare</a>\'s <a href="/search/?q=Goldeneye">GoldenEye 007</a>. There are 14 missions with three difficulty settings (Agent, Special Agent, 00 Agent), and higher difficulty settings add increasingly complicated objectives to each mission. An "awards" system encourages replay by granting new multiplayer skins, maps, and modes for beating target times for single-player levels.</p>\n<p>The game includes a local, split-screen multiplayer mode for up to four players or a combination of computer-controlled bots. Some levels are taken from single-player mode, while others are exclusive to multiplayer. New game modes include King of the Hill, Capture The Briefcase, and Last Agent Standing. The notorious Golden Gun also returns from <em>GoldenEye 007</em>, and retains its one-shot-kill power. Weapon groups and victory conditions can be tweaked at the start of a multiplayer match.</p>',

      '<p>Joanna Dark is an agent for the Carrington Institute, a secret organization funded by anonymous sources and dedicated to protecting the world. Through their highly trained operatives and special devices (gadgets), Carrington keeps an eye on terrorists, world powers, and strange happenings. The speed at which the dataDyne corporation has established itself through the development of new technologies is starting to worry the institute. So when Carrington receives a message from Dr. Caroll, a scientist wishing to escape dataDyne, they send their best agent, Joanna, to infiltrate the company headquarters.</p>\n<p><em>Perfect Dark</em> is a 3D first-person shooter similar to Rare\'s earlier <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3528/goldeneye-007/">GoldenEye 007</a>, though with more of an emphasis on stealth. Joanna can pick up and use a variety of firearms, including shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, various explosives, and others. In addition, she carries quite a few spy gadgets such as IR scanners, night vision, probes, and a deadly laptop. Most weapons have secondary fire modes and reloading them is displayed in an on-screen animation. </p>\n<p>Shields are scattered through the stages and can be picked up for additional protection. There are no health-restoring items and Joanna cannot jump. Like <em>GoldenEye 007</em>, the game has three difficulty levels, with the higher ones featuring more accurate enemies, less ammo, and more objectives for the player to complete within each mission. Cutscenes with voice acting advance the story between missions.</p>\n<p>The game also features a training mode set in the Carrington Institute. Completing the firing range challenge there unlocks the classic weapons from <em>GoldenEye 007</em>. In addition, the campaign can be played in a co-operative mode for two human players or one human player and up to three computer-controlled teammates (in split-screen mode), as well as in a "Counter Operative" mode, where one of the players takes control of an enemy and tries to stop Joanna from fulfilling her mission. </p>\n<p>Multiplayer includes a variety of modes. Among those are the traditional deathmatch as well as the objective-based Capture the Flag and King of the Hill modes. Other scenarios and objectives include surviving as long as possible while carrying a briefcase, hacking computer systems with randomly placed data uplinks, and hunting down a single player as a team. Stages, teams, and weapon placement can be customized by players.</p>\n<p>The Xbox 360 port has redone graphics to support a 1080p full HD resolution at 60 frames per second. It also incorporates full multiplayer support over Xbox LIVE.</p>',

      '<p>Famed SNES racer <a href="/search/?q=F-Zero">F-Zero</a> gets a 64-bit update. Gameplay remains essentially unchanged, race in a futuristic racing tournament on tracks levitated miles up in the air, against a selection of devious opponents.</p>\n<p>While the original had 4 cars to choose from and race against, F-Zero X has no fewer than 30 vehicles all with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, a choice of colours, and customisable power/acceleration ratios for each track. At the beginning you are limited to choosing from 6 cars and 3 tournaments (each featuring 6 tracks each), but in true Nintendo fashion, more cars and tracks are unlocked as you progress through the game. As well as the cups, you can also race in time trial mode, against a \'ghost car\' recording of your best previous lap, a lá <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3535/mario-kart-64/">Mario Kart 64</a>.</p>\n<p>Gone are the entirely flat tracks of the original, having been replaced with tracks that twist, turn, loop, rotate and basically contort into the most crazy shapes you could imagine. One unique feature amongst almost all other racing games is the "X" tournament, where courses are totally randomly generated each time you start.</p>\n<p>One of the most important changes to the format is the inclusion of multiplayer support for up to 4 players. The various combat moves are especially important against aggressive human play.</p>',

      '<p>The game takes place in the Western United States during a time of world-wide oil shortage in 1976. An organization known as OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage everywhere except in the United States. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn. His job, aided by five hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the country to its knees. When gas prices went wild, six civilians who called themselves Vigilantes, led by the truck driver Convoy, began fighting against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding.</p>\n<p><em>Vigilante 8</em> is a vehicular combat game similar to <a href="/search/?q=Twisted+Metal">Twisted Metal</a> in concept. Players can choose from eight characters with different agendas, and select vehicles ranging from classic 1970\'s muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with various kinds of weapons. Unlockables include two hidden levels (three in the Nintendo 64 version) and five hidden characters and cars. Multiplayer is also included: the PlayStation version allows two players (four in the Nintendo 64 version) to go head-to-head.</p>',

      '<p>While technology may improve graphics and sound, some things never change. <em>Rampage 2: Universal Tour</em> is very much in tune with its history, barely deviating from the original city-stomping arcade game appearing in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/4252/rampage-world-tour/">Rampage World Tour</a>, <em>Rampage 2</em> retains the original 2D worlds, but improves the graphics, completely re-rendering the characters. The premise remains the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in <em>Rampage 2</em> include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. Up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.</p>',

      "<p>Adam Crowley, a once-respected scientist, now turned to black magic, has released a demonic contagion onto the streets of 1834 London. Based on the long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates its victim's bodies into grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of murderous brutes. When Dr. Jean F. began investigating, he was murdered. Now, as either his friend Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his daughter Nadia, a biologist and gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of Hectate, and the man behind it all, Adam Crowley.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat. Ignatius and Nadia have different fighting styles and special moves. To keep things moving, an adrenaline meter depletes, killing the hero if it ever runs out. Kill monsters to top it up again. Gather special items to use on enemies, or just kill them using basic weapons.</p>",
