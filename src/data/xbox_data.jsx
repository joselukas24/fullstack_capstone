      '<p>In 1981, a sequel to <a href="/search/?q=Pac-Man">Pac-Man</a> was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, <em>Ms. Pac-Man</em>. This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.</p>\n<p>Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.</p>\n<p>Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800, and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost\'s eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.</p>\n<p>Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</p>',

      "<p>A young man named Eike Kusch strolls through the quiet patriarchal German town Lebensbaum. Suddenly, a tremendous blow darkens the sight of his eyes, and the next thing he can see is a very strange room filled with bizarre objects, and a voice talking to him from nowhere. A mysterious being known as Homunculus tells Eike that he has been stabbed to death. Homunculus gives Eike a time-travelling device and brings him back to life a short while before his murder took place. From that moment on, Eike's miraculously acquired second chance turns into a constant race against time, as he tries to escape from his destiny. In order to alter the course of events, preventing the unknown person from carrying out his murder, Eike will have to travel back in time as far as the 16th century, meeting people closely connected to his own existence and changing the fabric of reality.</p>\n<p><em>Shadow of Memories</em> (<em>Shadow of Destiny</em> in North America) is an adventure game. There are no action elements in the game, and the protagonist has no health bar. Each chapter has a time limit, during which Eike has to find a way to prevent the murderer from killing him. This is mainly achieved by traveling through time to different hours, days, years, and even centuries. Obtaining a crucial item, having a conversation with a specific character, or performing another action in the past will prevent Eike from getting killed. Time-traveling requires energy units, which can be found by exploring the town. If Eike fails to achieve the goal at hand within the allotted time and prevent his murder, the chapter must be restarted.</p>\n<p>During the course of the game the player will have several choices and opportunities to change the future in various ways. Due to the time-traveling feature, many objectives can be accomplished in non-linear ways, branching the storyline and eventually resulting in eight different endings, six of which can be achieved during the first playthrough, and two others unlocked after having reached the other six.</p>",

      '<p>A port of the arcade game, <em>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</em> is the follow-up to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3590/gauntlet-legends/">Gauntlet: Legends</a> and another installment in the long-running <a href="/search/?q=Gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the <em>Gauntlet</em> games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never-ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. </p>\n<p>This version contains the characters and levels from <em>Gauntlet: Legends</em>, plus the new characters and levels from the <em>Dark Legacy</em> arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.</p>\n<p>There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you\'ll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there is some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. </p>\n<p>Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird\'s eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the gameplay is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.</p>\n<p>While levels can be gained and characters saved, <em>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</em> is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.</p>',

      '<p>Max Payne was a police officer of the New York City police. On one terrible day, his wife and newborn daughter were killed by three junkies, who broke into his apartment after having ingested a new designer drug known as Valkyr. After the tragedy, Max quit the police force and joined the Drug Enforcement Administration. Three years later, during a raid on a mafia compound that was reportedly trafficking Valkyr, his best friend and fellow DEA agent Alex is killed, and he becomes the prime suspect in his murder. Now Max is all alone in the cold, snowy night of New York. The mob is out to get him. The police are out to get him. The only way out is with guns blazing, because he has nothing to lose.</p>\n<p><em>Max Payne</em> is a third person shooter stylistically influenced by film noir, "hardboiled" detective stories, and Hong-Kong action cinema. Max can perform rolls and leaps to try and dodge enemy fire. The weapons at his disposal range from baseball bats to Ingram sub-machine guns, grenades, Molotov cocktails, and others. A unique feature of the game is the usage of the so-called <em>Bullet Time</em> - a time-slowing ability that was popularized by the first <a href="/search/?q=Matrix"> Matrix</a> movie. Activating the Bullet Time slows down everything that happens around Max (including his own movements), allowing for slow, but precise performance of moves to take care of his enemies. A special meter indicates how much time the effect will last, and how long Max needs to wait until it can be activated again.</p>\n<p>Cutscenes in the game are presented as comic book-style graphical panels accompanied by voice-overs.</p>',

      '<p>A fighting game with characters taken from many Capcom and SNK games. The game system is centered around "grooves" which are selected before any battle. These different grooves alter the character\'s abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated to each company, and even the option to define a custom groove.</p>\n<p>The "EO" of the GameCube and Xbox titles refer to a new groove: Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions.

Also included is a sixth ending to the main scenario and a minor feature that allows the player to turn off the graphical effect, which makes the game look like it was shot on cheap film stock.</p>',

Hockey may have fewer rules than football, but NHL Hitz features hard-hitting action and very simple 3-on-3 gameplay.  The game has franchise modes for a created team that you can design along with championship and exhibition modes.  You earn attribute points and credits that you can use to unlock items and improve your players along the way.  There are several mini-games and extras hidden deep in the game for you to unlock.  NHL Hitz is Midway's attempt at making the most action-packed hockey game to ever hit consoles.</p>",

      "<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>\n<p>The object of the game is to score as many points as possible by swapping adjacent gems to create sets, either horizontal or vertical, of 3 or more identical gems.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Swap any two adjacent gems by clicking on one, then the one you want to swap it with. The gems must be adjacent vertically or horizontally (not diagonally).</p>\n<p>You must create a valid set of three or more identical gems with each move, or the gems will revert back to their original position.</p>\n<p>Sets can be either horizontal or vertical, and can contain more than 3 gems. When you have successfully created a set, they will disappear and new gems will fall into place, possibly creating a chain reaction or 'cascade' of more sets.</p>\n<p>You can also swap gems by clicking on one, then dragging it in the direction you want to swap. This can be faster and more efficient once you're used to it!</p>\n<p><strong>Hints</strong></p>\n<p>You can get a Hint at any time by clicking the purple Hint button on the left-hand control bar. This will cause a gem onscreen to flash briefly, indicating that it can be used to create a set.</p>\n<p>However, every time you use the Hint button, you will lose points!</p>\n<p>In Timetrial mode, you will also lose several seconds of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Options</strong></p>\n<p>The Options are accessible from the first game selection screen, or by clicking the Menu button while playing the game. They include:</p>\n<p>* Music Volume and Sound Effects: you can adjust these volume sliders separately to fit your preferences.\n * Fullscreen: If this is checked, <em>Bejeweled Deluxe</em> will use your entire computer screen. If it is not checked, Bejeweled Deluxe will be played in a window. It’s up to you to decide which you prefer.\n * Custom Cursors: If this box is checked, you will see special custom Bejeweled Deluxe cursors in the game rather than Windows standard cursors. If you have a special theme installed that changes your Windows cursors, you may need to activate this option to see the cursor properly in the game.\n * Help: This will show you instructions on how to play Bejeweled Deluxe.\n * High Scores: This will show you your best scores in both normal and timetrial modes.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p>\n<p>You can play Bejeweled in either Normal or Timetrial mode. Switch modes by clicking the appropriate button on the left-hand control bar. You will have to abandon your game in progress to switch game modes.</p>\n<p><strong>Normal Mode</strong></p>\n<p>In Normal mode, there is no timer and you can take as long as you like to make each move. The game will end when there are no more available moves.</p>\n<p>Every set or cascade you create will cause the Bonus Bar at the bottom of the screen to increment upwards. When the Bonus Bar is full, you will proceed to the next level.</p>\n<p>Each successive level increases the value of all sets and combos!</p>\n<p><strong>Timetrial Mode</strong></p>\n<p>Timetrial mode is for experienced Bejeweled players who want a fast-paced challenge. In Timetrial, the Bonus Bar at the bottom of the screen continually counts down towards zero. When it hits the bottom, your game is over.</p>\n<p>You can replenish the Bonus Bar by creating sets and combos. The bigger the combo or cascade, the more the Bonus Bar will be regenerated.</p>\n<p>Filling the Bonus Bar will take you to the next level. Sets and combos are worth more on each successive level, but the timer will also count down much faster!</p>\n<p>You can press any key to pause the game while playing Timetrial.</p>",

      "<p>This was the fourth and final version of the Championship Manager 3 game engine. The basic gameplay is as ever - take control of a football team (literally thousands are offered, from 26 leagues) and aim to make them the best in the country and then the world.</p>\n<p>Your players are depicted via a huge selection of statistics, covering their abilities, histories and performances (in each match they are rated out of 10; average ratings to 2 decimal places are among the stats saved for every one of the 30 seasons you can play for). A huge number of preset tactics are available, and each player's individual role can be customised for each area of the field. The transfer system allows you to scout for players all over the world and sign them permanently or on loan, with other clubs trying to do the same, and bidding for your players. You choose training schedules for each player, and watch their performance change as a result.</p>\n<p>As well as updating the player and team data to account for transfers and promotions / relegations, a number of new features are included in the game. The transfer system changes in line with new EU rules limiting the length and binding nature of contracts, you can compare player stats side by side, and send players away for rehabilitation. There's also more interaction with the club's owners and the league officials. An extra challenging option of Attribute Masking is added - this results in obscure information being hidden, and requiring more scouting to discover.</p>",

Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC\'s "It\'s Tricky" to play. </p>\n<p>Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include "behind-the-scenes" footage and a "making of" segment.</p>',

      "<p>Humanity is in the midst of a long war against an alien alliance called the Covenant which has been wiping out colony after colony. Your hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol makes a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin, and function with the Covenant on their heels. Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.</p>\n<p><em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> is a sci-fi first-person shooter with considerable driving elements. Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.</p>\n<p>Only two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on backup. There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.</p>\n<p>Your life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item that is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.</p>\n<p>One of the most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single-player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies. Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.</p>\n<p><em>Halo</em> also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.</p>",

      "<p>Munch is a lonely Gabbit - a gentle frog-like creature who communicates with other members of its species through echolocation. Munch searches in vain for others of his kind: his entire race has been exterminated, since the Gabbit eggs (\"gabbiar\") is a delicacy, and their lungs have been used by the chain-smoking, powerful Glukkons to replace their own. The last of the Gabbits is captures by two Vykkers, owners of Vykkers Labs, where they conduct experiments on living creatures. The two implant a sonar device in Munch's head, concocting a plan to enslave him and use him to trap other animals. However, Munch discovers that the implant has given him new powers; using those, he begins to free the vicious Fuzzles, whom the Vykkers have been using in their laboratories, hoping to escape himself and help other creatures who suffer under the yoke of the Glukkons.</p>\n<p><em>Munch's Oddysee</em> is set in the fictional Oddworld universe; its events take place after those of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3077/oddworld-abes-exoddus/\">Abe's Exoddus</a>. The player controls Munch as well as Abe, the hero of the previous <em>Oddworld</em> games. Abe's abilities haven't changed much since the last installment: as before, GameSpeak must be used to communicate with other creatures, leading them to safety. His fellow Mudokons can now be ordered to attack enemies. Abe can also grab and toss Mudokons or Munch to lead them to area they cannot access otherwise. Possessing enemies also comes into play, and is needed to solve many of the puzzles. Possession abilities can now be used to ignite quarrels between enemies and make them fight each other. </p>\n<p>The player can change between Abe and Munch instantly throughout most of the game. Munch brings on the table new abilities of his own: he can use his sonar to control or immobilize specific creatures, as well as swim. Another new addition is the possibility to use vending machines, which sell various items that enhance the abilities of the protagonists. At certain points Abe and Munch can also remote-control mechanical creatures.</p>",

It also makes full use of the X-Box's power.  Volumetric grass, accurate reflections, clothes that get dirty over the course of the game, snow that leaves footprints, then gradually turns to grass as you stomp on it, then gets covered again.</p>\n<p>Fever offers many game modes, including Season and Dynasty.  In Dynasty mode, you guide one or more teams through multiple seasons, managing every aspect of your team.  Rosters, positions, build the dream team that everyone fears.</p>",

      '<p>After his father was murdered by a mysterious Chinese man known as Lan Di, Ryo Hazuki swears to avenge his death. After a futile search for Lan Di in Yokosuka, Ryo is contacted by Chen Yao Wen, a Chinese master who advises him to travel to Hong-Kong and seek out Master Lishao Tao, who might be the only one who knows what had happened between Lan Di and Ryo\'s father in the past. Ryo arrives in Hong Kong and starts searching for a man who is his only link to the elusive murderer.</p>\n<p><em>Shenmue II</em> is a direct sequel to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3558/shenmue/">Shenmue</a>, continuing its story. The game\'s structure and basic gameplay elements are similar to those of the first game, incorporating elements of adventure, fighting, and light role-playing within a life simulation experience. Ryo explores vast 3D environments, talks to people to gather clues, and occasionally participates in fighting sequences. Like in the previous game, Ryo can train to become stronger in battles, and gradually learns new moves, which constitutes the role-playing element of the game.</p>\n<p>The game\'s environments are based on real locations in Hong Kong. The game world is significantly larger than that of its predecessor. The game also has a somewhat more linear story progression with numerous precise objectives, though free-form exploration is available during most of the game. Earning money plays a more important role, and many objectives are built around Ryo having to take part-time jobs (most of which are shaped like action mini-games) or participate in fights to win money. Like in the first game, Ryo can visit the arcades and play exact replicas of older arcade games, e.g. <a href="/search/?q=Outrun">OutRun</a>.</p>\n<p>The sequel features a larger amount of characters who take part in the story. Some of them also accompany Ryo on his journey, helping him in fights or other dangerous situations. The game also noticeably increases the amount of quick-time events (QTEs). Several key sequences are composed entirely out of cutscenes during which the player has to rapidly press combinations of buttons in order to execute the correct action. Many major fights in the game also include extensive QTE segments, often serving as a culmination of the fight.</p>\n<p>The Xbox version of the game comes with an additional DVD called <em>Shenmue: The Movie</em>, which contains a summation of the first <em>Shenmue</em> made into a feature-length movie.</p>',

Players can choose between many snowboards, each licensed from a different sponsor of the game. The goal of the career mode is two rack up as many points as possible and rise in the ranking. This also rewards skill points which can be used to improve the player character's abilities.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that players find themselves on descending (and branching) courses, overall 120 in three areas, with many possibilities to perform stunts. Of course those are needed to progress in the ranking, but the game takes track of two different scores: the overall course record and media stunts in front of the press. Special events are sponsor races, in which the sponsors have to impressed during the whole race, and duels, in which the course progression of another snowboarder has to emulated and the point result surpassed. The game features a soundtrack of 150 songs along with the possibility to incorporate own music tracks.</p>",

The first four have each three racing tracks and three arenas that increase in difficulty.</p>\n<p>The racing mode is split in four different race types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Training: for exploration and practice of the racecourse and setting personal records;</li>\n<li>Race: up to four different characters race each other over several rounds with the first one crossing the finish line winning;</li>\n<li>Popolopoï: one must reach the finish line before time runs out. Time can be replenished by shooting some kind of butterflies called Popolopoï and no opponents are to be beaten;</li>\n<li>Lums: over three laps, a certain amount of Lums have to be collected and one must beat the other opponents to the finish line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The arena battle mode is split in three different battle types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lum Spring: the first to collect five Lums/crystals or the one with the most Lums when time runs out wins. Ice bullets can be fired at an opponent to temporarily freeze them and beat them to the Lum;</li>\n<li>Lum Fight: all players start with five hit points each that need to be shot off with weapons found around the arena. A point is scored if a player shoots off the last hit point of another player. The first to reach a certain amount of points or the one with the most points when time runs out wins. When killed through one’s own actions, a negative point is scored;</li>\n<li>Capture the Fly: the goal is to find and capture a Light-Fly. The fly follows you around and gives you a point when a certain amount of time has passed. One loses control of the fly when hit by an opponent's bullet. The first to reach a certain amount of points or the one with the most points when time runs out wins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Playable characters include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rayman: the series main protagonist.

      '<p><em>Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex</em> is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original PlayStation. The story is set sometime after <a href="/search/?q=Bandicoot+Warped">Warped</a>: Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. Crunch\'s power source is a set of magical masks known as the Elementals, each representing a different element, including Earth, Water, Fire, and Ice. The warp room splits levels into their respective elements, with the boss of each section being a battle against Crunch influenced by the Elemental mask of said section. </p>\n<p>The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.</p>',

There are ten missions per side, for a total of twenty missions. Missions range from destroying cars to picking up documents to rescuing people.</p>\n<p>The game sports a real-time damage modeling system, so cars will break apart depending on how much they are damaged. Hoods and doors will pop loose and fly off, glass will shatter and break, license plates will get knocked loose and swing from side to side before finally falling off. The environment can be damaged as well, with street carts falling to pieces and neon signs exploding into a shower of sparks. Each side starts with a default car, but both gain access to exclusive new rides as they complete missions or by finding and touching hidden cars during levels.</p>",

      "<p>About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.</p>\n<p>They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.</p>\n<p><em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em> takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.</p>\n<p>Most completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, even those that never appear in <em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em>.</p>",

      "<p><em>007: Agent Under Fire</em> is the first James Bond game to appear on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world. Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch. Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries. Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon's hands. So James Bond sets off on another adventure...</p>\n<p>The game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.</p>",

      "<p><em>Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance</em> is an action RPG which casts the player as one of three basic characters: an elf sorceress, a human archer, or a dwarf fighter. From humble beginnings slaying rats in the cellars of an inn, the adventurer will move on to exploring caves, crypts, and mountain passes. Naturally, it's all filled to the brim with horrible monsters, wicked traps, treasures, and fabled magical weapons. As the game progresses, the player is constantly rewarded with new weaponry, new monsters to fight, and experience points to put into the adventurer's character stats to grow even more powerful. The adventurer must eventually unravel the secrets of a dark, new Thieves Guild backed by powerful mages.</p>",

      '<p>A follow up to the Dreamcast title <a href="/search/?q=Jet+Grind+Radio">Jet Grind Radio</a>. The setting is Tokyo in the year 2024. Freedom is a valuable commodity and freedom of expression even more so. Gangs of misbehaving teens strap on rocket-powered roller blades and skate, grind, and mark their territory with graffiti tags.</p>\n<p>Players take the role of the GGs, and can choose between any member of the gang, each with different stats, while in gang HQ. The city of Tokyo can be leisurely explored without a time limit, but the heat will be turned up when story missions are activated and the GGs find themselves being challenged by rival gangs or under attack from the cops. This time around spraying no longer requires thumbstick inputs; just roll up and start spraying away, although large tags still require more cans than smaller tags. Each section of the city has hidden objectives that are revealed by finding a hidden tape, and once completed these challenges will unlock new graffiti patterns.</p>\n<p>In multiplayer modes players can challenge each other to races, point battles, and other competitions both in zones from the single player game as well as in special arenas.</p>',

She married Marcus de Leon, the governor of the Pirate Isles, and they had a daughter named Katarina. The governor always wanted to protect her from the dangers of a pirate's life - especially after her mother disappeared without a trace. But when the ruthless Captain Hawke begins to terrorize the islands with his gang, the Crimson Guard, Katarina realizes she must find a way to stop him at all costs.</p>\n<p><em>Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat</em> is an action game consisting of two main modes: sailing and land exploration. While sailing, Katarina's ship encounters hostile vessels and may engage in naval battles. The player must explore islands on foot to find special items that would unlock new areas on the map. Each island is a fairly linear area with respawning enemies hindering Katarina's progress. The player can also find keys allowing him to unlock treasure chests, and search for various items for collecting purposes.</p>",

      "<p>Following the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2207/blood-omen-legacy-of-kain/\">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen</a>, the vampire Kain has assembled an army of vampires to take over the world of the humans. Fighting across Nosgoth, his goal is to make his way to the great city of Meridian and take control of this stronghold. However, upon reaching the gates of the city, the army is challenged by the Serafan Order, an organized force of vampire hunters and its leader, the magical Serafan lord. Kain engages the Serafan lord in single combat, is struck down and defeated. Kain's sword, the Soul Reaver, is claimed by his enemy. Unconscious for 200 years, Kain awakes under the care of the vampire Umah to a world he barely recognizes. Following the defeat of Kain's army, the vampires have been hunted down by the Serafan and only a few remain. The city of Meridian is ruled under martial law by the Serafan Order, which is very oppressive towards its citizens. Strange glyph magic is used to power machines and fuel industry and at the same time is deadly to vampires and used as wards throughout the city. Kain swears revenge on the one who defeated him and seeks to reclaim his place as the ruler of the vampires.</p>\n<p><em>The Legacy of Kain Series: Blood Omen 2</em> is a third person action game with adventure elements, more similar in perspective to <a href=\"/search/?q=Soul+Reaver\">Soul Reaver</a> than the first <em>Blood Omen</em> game. The player views the environment from behind Kain's shoulder, moving him in different directions, attacking, jumping, using dark gifts, and grabbing on to ledges. Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform stealth kills which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands or by picking up daggers, swords, axes, and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and may also be thrown at enemies from afar.</p>\n<p>The Serafan Order uses glyph magic, partially because it is deadly to vampires. Kain will often encounter areas where he is barred from progressing because of glyph barriers and must find a way around them. Additionally, glyphs function similar to electricity in that they power machines and switches. Many of the puzzles featured in <em>Blood Omen 2</em> involve needing to create a glyph circuit in order to deliver power to a specific point. Glyph energy glows as it travels down its path, allowing the player to see exactly where the energy spark is.</p>",

      "<p>Based loosely on the vehicles, events and characters of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, you must pilot the new Jedi Starfighter, a sleek force powered vehicle, to defend a planet from total destruction. </p>\n<p>Jedi Adi Gallia  is trusted by her former master Mace Windu to stop an incoming invasion on the Karthak system planned by Cavic Toth. With the aid of Nym and his ship Havoc, you must control both the Jedi Starfighter and the Havoc to stop the incoming invasion.</p>\n<p>The Jedi Starfighter, much like a Jedi, uses force powers as its main weapons and defense systems. You can use the likes of Force Lightning and Force Shockwave to knock down enemies, and defend yourself with Force Shield and Force Reflex.</p>\n<p>Also included on disk is a two player co-operative mode and deatmatch/capture the flag options.</p>",

    description:
      "<p>Freed by the decree of Uriel Septim VII, the Emperor of Tamriel, a lone prisoner is transported to the province of Morrowind. It seems that the strange dreams this prisoner has been having lately may have a connection to equally strange events occurring there. The protagonist is given a simple assignment: join the Blades, a secret organization whose goal is to protect the safety of the Emperor. This leads to a discovery of an ancient prophecy and an evil scheme concocted by a powerful deity whom the protagonist alone is able to stop.</p>\n<p>Conceived in the tradition of the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> series, <em>Morrowind</em> is a fantasy role-playing game with a vast world open for exploration. After being released from a prison ship at the shores of the island Vvardenfell, the protagonist may do more or less what he or she wants: follow the main quest and solve the mystery of an ancient prophecy, join any of roughly a dozen guilds and rise in their hierarchy by performing duties, or simply explore the gigantic island with its stylistically diverse cities, hundreds of dungeons and tombs, ancient ruins and mighty fortresses. </p>\n<p><em>Morrowind</em> uses a two-stage skill system. The hero’s primary stats (strength etc.) increase with each level gained, while secondary abilities improve by use – for example, the more often the character jumps, the more proficient he or she becomes in the Acrobatics skill, etc. The action-oriented fights are simple exchanges of strikes or spells, until one combatant dies. The enemy's hit points and condition were not originally shown; however, at the request of customers a health bar was added for enemies as part of the first upgrade patch.</p>\n<p>The protagonist's race and gender, but also his or her reputation influence the reactions of NPCs. If a character’s sympathy for the hero is low (rated on a scale from 1 to 100), he might refuse to answer questions; if it is high, the player will get more detailed information and better bargains in shops. Most quests involving other persons can be solved by persuasion, pick-pocketing, or simply by force.</p>\n<p>The game's NDL 3D game engine is powerful in drawing wide, detailed outdoor landscapes as well as complex indoor environments. Transitions are not fluent; houses and dungeons must be loaded upon entering.</p>",

The gameplay is comparable to <a href=\"/search/?q=NFL+Blitz\">NFL Blitz</a> or <a href=\"/search/?q=NHL+Hitz\">NHL Hitz</a>.</p>\n<p>Players choose from one of 32 international teams and duke it out in the most realistic of Midway's 2003 extreme sports games. This game features full size teams and plays much like a real soccer title until you dropkick one of your opponents to the ground. It doesn't go all out like most of Midway's hard-hitting games, but it definitely stands closer to Midway's extreme sports games than a traditional simulation.</p>",

In this game, you are racing on realistic streets with real traffic to contend with.</p>\n<p>There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA. There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups. However, they are not based on real makes and models.</p>\n<p>One notable feature of Burnout is the "Burn Meter." The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic or power-drifting through corners. Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost. If you crash, however, the Burn Meter is reset and must be filled again to achieve a boost.</p>',

It is based on the engine of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/111790/fifa-soccer-2002/\">FIFA Soccer 2002</a>, so experienced Fifa players can get used for it quite fast. </p>\n<p>It is based on the 2002 World Cup - Korea and Japan and includes all of the countries who promoted to the World Cup, and a lot more. Small statistics are shown for every country - their last biggest win, appearances at the World Cup, etc.</p>\n<p>The stadium and all players are really detailed. The player's texture's resolution is so high, you can easily recognize most of them. The stadium is big and impressive and full of colored crowd.</p>\n<p>As in <em>FIFA Soccer 2002</em>, the animation was taken from real players, with motion sensors. Thus, some new animation was added - new sliding, falling, and more.</p>\n<p>And the newest feature of <em>2002 FIFA World Cup</em>, is the air ball control model. You can take balls from the air, and have much more control with them - creating great goals from the air.</p>",

      "<p>The first game in the Outlaw series of sports titles, <em>Outlaw Golf</em> is what you get when you take the classic game of golf and throw in lesbian strippers, wannabe rappers, ex cons and other wild personalities. The game has a bad attitude chock full of sexual themes and language that puts Happy Gilmore to shame.</p>\n<p><em>Outlaw Golf</em> pits you as one of ten over-the-top golfing personalities (paired with equally over-the-top caddies) to compete in over 30 different tour events from where you attempt to unlock new characters, better clubs and balls as well as improving your golfer's skills along the way with 12 different mini-games. The game also sports a composure response system, which simply means that when you do well, the game is easier and when you aren't doing so well you will find your shots not going exactly where you want them. Composure too low? Beat up your caddy and you can relieve some of that stress to regain your lost composure. Multiplayer supports 8 different game modes, including stroke play, match play, skins, best ball and casino with up to four players.</p>",

Each player chooses from one of four classes: the Avenger, Martyr, Defender, or Judge. Each one possesses different strengths and weaknesses along with their own individual set of spells.

      "<p>Kate Walker is a lawyer who has been entrusted by the Universal Toy Company to negotiate the takeover of an old luxury toy and automaton factory. Over the centuries, the factory has been developing clockwork devices, specializing in perpetual mechanical movement. The factory's ambitions, however, are ill-suited to the contemporary economic climate, and the elderly Anna Voralberg, at the helm of the Valadilene factory for more than half a century, has decided to sell up. </p>\n<p>It turns out that the takeover might not be as straightforward as expected. The day that Kate Walker arrives, Anna Voralberg is being buried. What is more is that she has left an heir – her brother Hans. But Hans had left the valley at the end of the thirties and never returned, and was actually believed to be dead. However, a letter written by Anna in the days leading up to her death reveals that Hans is well and truly alive and living somewhere in Siberia. Valadilene's elderly notary entrusted to take care of Anna's affairs suggests that Kate find Hans Voralberg as he is now the only person in a position to ratify the sale of the family business. </p>\n<p><em>Syberia</em> is a traditional puzzle-solving adventure. The player navigates a 3D model of the protagonist over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles. Puzzles are mostly inventory-based, though some involve manipulating the environment (such as mechanical devices). The interface features a single cursor; only highlighted objects can be interacted with, and there are no verb choice commands.</p>",

      "<p><em>Nightcaster: Defeat the Darkness</em> is a third-person, single-player, action-adventure game featuring spell combat and exploration. Players take the role of Arran, a novice wizard whose magical power grows as he ages throughout his quest to collect spells and rid the world of eternal night.</p>\n<p>Players can choose brute force or smart tactics. Each school of magic is effective against a different color of enemy, and different schools will have spells with different effects as they level up. The schools are made up of over 40 spells, either light, dark, fire, or water. Spells can either be summoned right in front of Arran, or, by dislodging the magic stone on his staff and guiding it around him with the right thumbstick, fired with precision in any direction. Many items can be found hidden in levels that will provide Arran with bonuses, like increased health or the ability to power up a spell, and these bonuses carry between levels.</p>",

      '<p>Combine the many tricks and styles of the extreme sport, inline skating, with a <a href="/search/?q=Tony+Hawk">Tony Hawk</a> style system, complete with objectives and huge arenas, and you have Aggressive Inline.</p>\n<p>Progress through the career mode, where you must complete objectives (such as grind a certain object(s) to jump over large gaps and gain points) to open up further arenas, which there are 7 in all, and once you are bored with them, you can make your own in the park editor. The game doesn\'t use a hard time limit but the so-called "juice meter": it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game, you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a "learning by doing" approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level that open up new areas within the level.</p>\n<p>10 pro inline skaters join the fun (<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/84320/shane-yost/">Shane Yost</a>, <a href="/search/?q=Sam+Fogarty">Sam Fogarty</a>, <a href="/search/?q=Sven+Boekhorst">Sven Boekhorst</a>, <a href="/search/?q=Eito+Yasuko">Eito Yasuko</a> and more), and you can take on a friend in 2 player split screen.</p>',

New features in NCAA Football for the 2003 season include over 200 licensed fight songs, 3D cheerleaders and 144 different schools.</p>\n<p>Dynasty mode has been enhanced with the ability to redshirt a player and schedule your non-conference games before each season. In Dynasty Mode you can win all the real trophies to add to your own personal collection which you can show off later. These awards include the Heisman, Coach of the Year and Bowl-specific trophies. You can also win special trophies for winning certain rivalry games, which is another new play mode in 2003. There are 23 different "Rivalry" trophies for you to earn to go alongside your Dynasty trophies. </p>\n<p>Create-A-School mode makes it into this edition, letting you create your own football team. Everything from the logos on the field to your school\'s fight song can be customized. Your created team can be played in Exhibition play or imported into Dynasty mode.</p>\n<p>The last notable feature new to NCAA Football 2003 is the customizable interface. You choose your favorite team and the game interface will be based around your team\'s fight song, mascot, logos and school colors.</p>',

      '<p><em>Dead to Rights</em> is a 3rd-person shooter in which the player is Jack Slate, a police officer in Grant City. On a routine call, he finds the dead body of his father. While trying to find the murderer, he is framed for another murder. Jack becomes a fugitive; his run from the law will take him to various places, from strip joints and hotels to office complexes, and even prison, as an inmate.</p>\n<p>When controlling Jack, players can perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, or tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion. If Jack does not have a gun drawn, he can disarm an enemy which causes him to steal the enemy\'s gun, then performing some sort of finish, such as a neck breaker. Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as the game progresses.</p>\n<p>Players will sometimes have to control Jack\'s best friend and partner, his K-9 dog Shadow, which allows enemies to be killed from a distance. In addition, Shadow will fetch their guns and bring them to Jack.</p>\n<p>The game also features "adrenaline combat", similar to "Bullet Time" from <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/4529/max-payne/">Max Payne</a>. Jack will then perform slow-motion dives and spins, giving him an advantage, as long as his adrenaline meter holds out.</p>',

      "<p>During a great war, the land of Celenheim was separated into two sides; the light side and the dark side. On the side of the Light, the Enclave was protected from all sides by a wide rift, a bottomless abyss. On the Dark side, twisted forms struggled for survival, while slowly growing more powerful, preparing to invade the Light side once again.</p>\n<p><em>Enclave</em> is a level-based action RPG game with a mix of shooting and puzzles, pitting the player as one of twelve different characters on either side in this medieval era. As a member of the Light side: a Knight, a Huntress, a Wizard, a Druid, an Engineer or a Halfling can be chosen. At the opposite end of the spectrum: a Berserker, an Assassin, a Sorceress, a Lich, a Bombardier, or a Goblin. The player needs to perform different tasks leading ultimately to one objective; protect the Enclave (Light) or invade the land (Dark). To accomplish these tasks, various weapons, such as swords, bows, staffs and spears, can be used. To aid the player, shields are readily available, as well as a select few potions. Armor is abundant and comes in many shapes and sizes.</p>",

    description:
      "<p>Arx was a once a prosperous place. However, after one night the sun of the world of Exosta never rose again, and the blistering cold forced their inhabitants into the dwarf mines. There, a new city was built, and humans, trolls, goblins, dwarves, and other races lived along peacefully, until the scarce resources proved to be too few for everyone. The animosity started to build up, and conflict between races ensued. The protagonist starts the game dazed out, being dragged into a cell by a goblin. Where is he? Why did he end up there? <em>Who</em> is he? With only that in mind, the adventure starts...</p>\n<p>Inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/108/ultima-underworld-series/\">Ultima Underworld</a> series, <em>Arx Fatalis</em> is a first-person role-playing game taking place in a vast underground world. All the locations and interconnected by passages, tunnels, and stairs, with eight levels altogether. Despite their dungeon-like appearance, locations also include populated settlements such as the city of Arx, where the player character can buy and store supplies, as well as other non-hostile areas. The player, however, is free to attack and possibly kill any non-player character encountered. While several main quests must be completed in a specific order to unlock a new area, the player can access and explore certain locations freely at some points in the game. There are no dialogue options, but some missions can be completed in different ways, and there are also a few side quests.</p>\n<p>The player generates and builds up the main character by customizing his main attributes (strength, intelligence, dexterity, and constitution) as well as various skills, which include close or ranged combat proficiencies, technical skill for lockpicking and disarming traps, and others. Vanquishing enemies and completing quests yields experience points, which are converted to attribute and skill points when the protagonists levels up and can be allocated manually. Much of the combat in the game can be avoided, and the player may opt to develop a stealthy character, a spellcaster, a ranged attacker, as well as the traditional physical type. </p>\n<p>Combat in the game is action-based. The player can press down the attack key to build up force in order to strike more efficiently. It is also possible to execute several types of melee attacks by combining them with directional arrows. One of the unique aspects of the game is the spell-casting system, where the player uses the mouse (or the directional pad in the Xbox version) to draw the runes constituting a particular spell. The most complex spells can be performed by combining runes. Spells can also be readied and cast simply by pressing a corresponding key. Casting spells depletes the protagonist's magic points. </p>\n<p>As some places lack light sources, players can take advantage of the darkness to stealthily move in the shadows, or use torches to lighten up a room to search for some object or find their way in a path. The game's world offers interactivity by allowing the player to pick up, drag, and place most objects. Food must be collected and eaten periodically to prevent the protagonist from dying of hunger. The player can combine various items to create new ones, as well as modify their properties. For example, it is possible to cook food, bake bread, use tools such as pickaxes and shovels, and brew potions.</p>",

      "<p>Tommy Angelo was an ordinary taxi driver trying to make a living on the streets of Lost Heaven until one day an unexpected meeting changed his life forever. Two men jump into his cab, telling him to drive as fast as he can. Bullets begin to hit the cab, and a car with armed pursuers gets closer. Barely escaping a violent death, Tommy obeys the instructions of the two men and delivers them to a bar of their choice.</p>\n<p>Impressed with his driving skills, the men pay him and offer him a job in the mafia. The next day, while Tommy is taking a coffee break, his cab is smashed by two rival gangsters. After this, he recalls the proposition from yesterday, and, without much hesitation, joins the Salieri family, making his first steps on the path of organized crime. While performing missions for Salieri, Tommy gradually begins to regret his choice. However, it turns out that joining the mafia was much easier than leaving it.</p>\n<p><em>Mafia</em> is an action and driving game set in the 1930s in Lost Heaven, a fictional city in the USA modeled after New York and Chicago of the Prohibition Era. Similar to <a href=\"/search/?q=Grand+Theft+Auto\">GTA</a> games, it consists of free-roaming (driving or on foot) in a large city, completing missions to advance the narrative. The missions often include driving to various locations, car chases, and one race; however, most of them are structured like fairly large and long third-person shooter levels.</p>\n<p>The player will have the chance to drive over sixty vehicles that are reminiscent of the 1930's period. Each car handles it differently, with various degrees of damage. It is possible to smash windows, destroy bumpers, lights, and mirrors, dent the car, shoot out the tires, or shoot the tires so much that they fall off. To add to the realism, if the car's gas tank gets punctured, gas will slowly leak out until the car totally empties. There are gas stations scattered throughout the city, allowing the player to refuel. With these vehicles, the player is able to explore twelve square miles of the city, visiting areas such as Central Island, Chinatown, and the Downtown district.</p>\n<p>Complementing the vehicles is an array of weapons, such as pistols, tommy guns, shotguns, explosives, baseball bats, and crowbars. While driving a car, Tommy can perform a drive-by, sticking his hand out the window and firing. Trying to impede him is the police force; they will act on anything suspicious. If they see Tommy carrying a weapon, they will attempt to arrest him. Going over the speed limit, running red lights, crashing into buildings, cars, or objects will result in fines.</p>\n<p>Tommy is often given new cars to use during the missions, usually provided by Ralph, the mechanic of the Salieri family. The player can also save hijacked cars in the backyard of the bar belonging to Salieri. Weapons can be acquired at the beginning of a mission by Vincenzo, the local arms dealer.</p>",

While attempting to escape the camp, Captain Stone discovers that the Germans are developing a secret weapon they intend to use against the Allies. Soon his personal wish of escape turns into a desire to save the world from the destruction the Nazis are planning.</p>\n<p><em>Prisoner of War</em> can be described as a stealth game. Unlike most other games of its kind (e.g. the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Thief">Thief</a> series), the game relies on stealth entirely, without offering violent options. The protagonist is helpless in the prison camp, and his only weapon is his wit. Sneaking past guards to deliver an important object to a fellow prisoner, hiding items, staying in shadows to avoid being recognized, and other stealth-based activities occupy the largest portion of the game.</p>',

The entire game is a fast paced, frantic battle for survival, hence the title. When spotted by an enemy, it will chase you until it's either killed or blocked, and running is often the only option. You will use a variety of weapons to defeat the aliens, such as a shotgun, and more futuristic weapons, like a pulse blaster and nerve destroyer.</p>",

      "<p>The perfect hitman, Agent 47, tries to distance himself from his violent past and becomes a humble church gardener. But he is tricked into returning to his trade when his friend, a priest, gets kidnapped by an Italian mafioso. \n<em>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</em> is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives. </p>\n<p>Typically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards. </p>\n<p>The guards aren't completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they'll react if they see you waving around a gun. They'll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they'll eventually realize you're not one of their buddies. </p>\n<p><em>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</em> brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a \"Mass Murderer\", while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the \"Silent Assassin\" rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion.</p>",
